# Manga chapter text extractor

This series of functions were created to extract and clean text from manga images. The extractor accuracy is around 90%. Although not all information is being extracted, a chat bot such as ChatGPT can make sense of the story, and provide a summary of each chapter and of the whole manga so far. 

Here are some business applications that come to mind:

## Localization and Translation: 
Speed up the localization process by extracting dialogue, making it easier for translators to work efficiently and reduce time to market for new releases.

##Â Content Indexing and Searchability: 
Extracted text could make manga content searchable, allowing digital platforms to offer better recommendation systems, keyword searches, or even interactive experiences.

## Marketing Insights: 
Analyzing character dialogues or themes can help publishers understand audience preferences, allowing them to market manga series more effectively or make data-driven creative decisions.

## Accessibility: 
Generate alternative text for visually impaired users, making manga more accessible by enabling better screen-reader compatibility.

This kind of tool bridges the gap between art, accessibility, and data-driven storytelling.
