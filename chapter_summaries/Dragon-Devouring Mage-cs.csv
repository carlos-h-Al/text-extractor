It's vibrating stronger... Is there something you want to tell me? Please tell me, Mother. This moment hints at a deeper connection with their destiny, leaving readers eager for what lies ahead.Overall, the chapter interweaves themes of familial legacy, personal struggle, and mystical connections, all set against the backdrop of a magical adventure."

They reminisce about past experiences, indicating that a return to previous circumstances is inevitable, accompanied by the threat of punishment.As they talk about the professors watching them, one character worries about getting in trouble for not taking notes. The urgency escalates as they decide to sneak away, warning that the academy's environment is not as safe as it seems, with a sense of camaraderie emerging amidst their chaotic antics.The atmosphere shifts dramatically as they confront rivals, with one character reminding another that even though they are in a school setting, the stakes can feel just as severe as past battles. Comparisons are drawn between the current conflicts and the intense killing intent experienced in the mercenary life, showing they are still contenders regardless of their current status.Conflict arises between the characters, pointing out their weaknesses, especially regarding magical prowess. The reminder that they cannot use magic within the academy’s walls leads to a challenge where one character brags about their martial skills developed from a history of familial failure. The dialogue hints at underlying rivalries and personal challenges, ultimately reflecting a dramatic yet comedic moment rooted in school life and personal growth."

They struggle to gain an opportunity but recognize the need to act quickly amid the chaos. The protagonist experiences a notification confirming the completion of a mission, which introduces a low-grade mana stone as a reward. They are hesitant but ultimately consume the stone, realizing it's akin to a time regression and an opportunity to enhance their mana. As the mana flows into a circle, it stabilizes, reigniting their hope to change their bleak fate—marked by family downfall and expulsion from the academy—into something brighter.Their professor notices they've been down, hinting at potential bullying by classmates. Acknowledging the concern, the protagonist thanks them but is quickly assigned a challenging report as punishment for dozing off in class. The protagonist, recalling their previous life where they worked diligently despite weak mana abilities, vows to balance studying and mana vein training, understanding that a strong mana vein is crucial for their magical potential.They express a sense of fate intertwining as they discover a historic site with hidden grimoires, promising to strengthen both their body and mana vein, seeking a transformation that bypasses their past limitations. Overall, the chapter emphasizes resilience, growth, and the protagonist's quest to harness their abilities."

The protagonist remembers their past experiences and anticipates that Russel, a student with narrowing mana veins, will be chosen. Hey?! Pick me instead of this bastard! someone shouts, highlighting the competition among students. As the selection proceeds, it becomes clear the professors often choose weaker students to encourage fair matchups. The main character reflects on the nature of magic, explaining that while some aspects like “understanding” and “construction” can be learned through hard work, a true “mental image” can only come from belief and imagination. This leads to powerful magic that defies the known world.While exploring, they encounter Darian Snow White, the esteemed master of the Flame Tower, who acknowledges the protagonist's potential. You're reading quite the interesting book there, she says, recognizing their stable mana distribution. Despite being over eighty, she maintains her youth, further impressing the protagonist.Darian offers encouragement, urging them to grow without fear. Grow to the best of your abilities, child, she advises, inspiring confidence. The chapter ends with tension as the students prepare for their upcoming magical battles, and the protagonist is determined to prove themselves against all odds."

With the teacher questioning how Russell could accomplish this, they delve into how he cleverly manipulates his magic during training, using a shield specifically designed to withstand fire and adapting it against attacks. As the combat intensifies, the other participants are astonished by Russell’s impressive casting speed, and there are murmurs of disbelief about how he is enduring powerful fire magic. Ultimately, the tension builds as Russell faces off against a stronger opponent, indicating a strategic approach where he plans to outlast his opponent by conserving energy, hoping for victory when their mana runs low.

With urgency, he commands everyone, RUN TO THE FORESTS! I need you to run away no matter what!However, despite the danger, one character stands firm, stating, I'm the only one who can buy time until the judges get here. Attempts to defend against the attack prove futile as it breaches their shield. Frustration mounts as someone realizes, Does it have a regeneration ability too?Conflicted emotions arise when they witness comrades risking their lives, prompting one to shout, Why are you all going back? Are you guys crazy? The situation escalates with the mention of a possible sacrifice spell alongside the emergence of a giant skeleton.The chapter concludes with a sense of urgency and unexpected alliances forming as they brace for battle, culminating in a poignant realization, This wasn't part of my plan."

A character expresses, Being fragile is a weakness, asserting the importance of the strong protecting the weak. This realization is shared: Because they are fragile, if one of them rises up, all of them do so as well! As they participate in a selection test, they face a significant challenge: ...if you make me move outside of this circle, you can use any magic you want, indicating the test's high stakes. Despite the chaos of a heretic attack, teamwork triumphs over individual competition. One character reflects on this, noting that the highest score in the tower selection...I can finally graduate from the academy.After their victory, they receive a reward for their teamwork, the reward of an intermediate-grade mana stone and question the fate of those who assisted them, underscoring the impact of collaboration in dire circumstances.By the end, the chapter hints at unresolved tensions with the mention of an ongoing investigation into the heretics and the acknowledgment of another looming threat, “actually, there was one more heretic.” The chapter concludes with a sense of hope and determination, setting the stage for future challenges."

A discussion about big dreams follows, with one character excitedly stating, I’ll tell the master about it if the other learns a powerful magic technique called Overheat, which is described as a one-hit kill magic.Amidst the conversation, there is a playful banter about discipline and the methods of a strict upbringing, with one remarking, What do you mean, 'Boomer'? highlighting a generational clash in perspectives.The chapter continues with a graduation speech from a character named Russel, revealing his achievement in summoning a spirit named Pepper. The dialogue indicates a transition as Russel is no longer a student and is now referred to as Senior Brother, leading to a discussion about staying arrangements in the capital.One character expresses concerns over getting a small room in the outskirts, while another insists, Stay at my place, showing camaraderie and support. The conversation shifts to a forbidden island swarming with magic beasts, raising curiosity and danger. As the chapter closes, there’s a hint of mystery and determination with one character wondering about the true opportunity presented to them, questioning whether it is meant to make them stronger or has another goal. Finally, the mission of tracking the Society of the Heretics is revealed, with one character expressing a strong desire to assist with it, signaling the beginning of a challenging journey ahead."

The Flame Tower Master brags about his disciple's abilities and promises to give up this rare artifact if his disciple can catch up to the Spear Tower Master’s disciple. The conversation reveals the immense power of these relics, mentioning that even the weakest ones contain powerful mana. As they discuss, the Flame Tower Master is reminded of the risks involved in using high-level magic, particularly a technique called Over Heat, which requires careful execution to avoid counterattacks. The high expectations set by these masters push their disciples to strive harder, with emphasis on the idea that underestimating others can lead to downfall. The Spear Tower Master discusses the impressive feats of his own disciple and the rivalry between them intensifies. As the meeting progresses, the playful dynamic between the masters emerges, hinting at their history and contrasting personalities, especially when the Flame Tower Master shows a more childish side in the presence of the Spear Tower Master. Although there's an air of competition, there's also camaraderie, setting the stage for a potential showdown between their disciples. This chapter concludes with a hint of anticipation for the upcoming challenges and developments in their magical journeys."

Fia acknowledges that they were hasty in their actions and offers to guide the others to the ruins, hinting at the tension as they can smell the blood of the Chasers nearby. Captain Fansha is informed that the pagans have left the city and considers pursuing them, while other characters report concerning news about the Flame Tower scouts.As dialogue unfolds, we see the urgency of the situation with mentions of missing scouts and the challenges that need resolving, particularly concerning the user of Draconic powers, whose effects are short-lived and come with dangerous recoil. The interaction between characters reveals their identities and roles; Jackson, disguised as the manager at the Yellow Wyvern, speaks with Ray from the Flame Tower about the missing scouts who were last spotted heading towards the desert ruins. They express skepticism about the scouts falling into a trap, given their seasoned nature.Ray’s determination to rescue the missing scouts contrasts with Jackson's caution, emphasizing the danger of the ruins being near the empire's borders. Tensions rise as trust issues arise between them. The chapter sets the stage for an urgent rescue mission, hinting at greater powers at play with references to magic and a mysterious figure controlling powerful forces. The interactions build anticipation for the upcoming challenges and confrontations."

The dialogue begins with a sense of urgency as someone instructs, Return the carriage and head to the Archduke's mansion. There’s something I need to check. It’s clear that a significant issue regarding the family's status is at stake.Amid discussions of obligations, one character expresses skepticism about the Raymond family's ability to fulfill their duties: The Raymond family owes a debt to the kingdom; they must pay it back. Another remarks on the emotional impact of such a decision on the kingdom's youth, highlighting that entrusting the mission to the Raymounds might not sit well.As the conversation escalates, accusations fly, with one character admonishing another not to get involved, stating, Kid, don’t get involved. I’ll handle this. There's a palpable animosity as someone threatens to tear out your tongue and turn you into an example.Princess Hekate makes her entrance, shifting the atmosphere, and asserts, If one owes a debt, one must pay it back. She orders the Red Tower and the Flame Tower to support an excavation, highlighting her influential role.In a tense exchange about the past and the recently deceased Raymond patriarch, one character admits, I didn’t exactly see it, but… that’s a shame. There’s a strong implication of deeper connections and unresolved issues.The chapter ends on a cliffhanger, with a character questioning another’s past relationship with the dead man, Were you acquainted with the dead Raymond? This creates a sense of mystery, hinting at complex relationships and the weight of legacy that the characters must navigate."

Amidst urgency, a character expresses concern that their magic spells are ineffective against it. They discuss the possibility of breaching the barrier using a relic from the Spear Tower but doubt they will easily obtain such a precious item. One character volunteers to go to the Spear Tower personally, highlighting their debt to the others for their past help. Another points out the dwindling number of War Mages, indicating the need to discuss duty rotations, especially for the night watch. Tensions rise as an external threat emerges, maintaining that the area is under the Yellow Tower's jurisdiction. There are discussions of blackmailing a character named Spiegelman to secure the artifact, and the implications of involving the “Divinity” of the Flame Tower are considered. The narrative hints at strict orders from the Archduke requiring absolute secrecy and the elimination of any survivors from the expedition, emphasizing high stakes.The chapter concludes with a sense of foreboding, as one character questions whether they can use an object given by the Archduke if things go awry, while another coldly confirms that after this mission, surviving will be impossible, pushing the tension further."

He wrestles with self-doubt and the scars of failure, even as he clings to the dream of becoming a mage—an endeavor met with skepticism and disdain from others.An argument ensues, showcasing the protagonist's determination to rise above his circumstances, even when ridiculed. He asserts, I’m gonna become a mage! highlighting his refusal to bow to the disdain of those who look down on him, regardless of their scorn or the pain tied to his mana issues. The chapter ends with frustration and a clear resolve, as the protagonist refuses to accept defeat, regardless of the challenging journey ahead.Overall, this chapter underscores themes of ambition, rejection, and the emotional turmoil of pursuing personal goals in the face of adversity."

Tasa states, I’ll stop this right now and admit that you are Blaine's shadow! He desires the mask that could enhance his powers, leading to a debate about the true meaning of strength. Jeron counters, emphasizing, “Power isn’t the most important thing,” highlighting a stark contrast in values.A notification reveals the mask's ability to assist with thinking and trigger dragon blood manifestation, with the prospect of a second draconification being possible. Jeron challenges Tasa’s understanding of courage, dismissing it as nonsense coming from someone who hasn't faced true darkness. Amidst the conflict, Tasa argues about his inner struggles, insisting, “Courage comes before it,” as he desperately clings to his ideals to gain the power he seeks. The chapter concludes with the tension unresolved, as both characters grapple with their ambitions and the sacrifices they are willing to make."

The dialogue highlights the King's appreciation for Russel, stating, Your praises are too generous, your Majesty, and honors him with the title of Count and an SRD-class military merit medal, further granting him tax levying rights in the region. Russel expresses gratitude for a past favor, saying, Thank you for saving my daughter, revealing the personal stakes involved.However, the court proceedings take a serious turn as Blaine, a defendant and the Red Tower Master, admits negligence in addressing the conspiracy of his apprentice, Jeron, with the pagans. The tension rises as the accusation weighs on Blaine but is countered by support for his past contributions to the kingdom. Ultimately, a resolution of six months of probation is suggested, showcasing a struggle for justice and accountability.The chapter also captures celebrations as knights are acknowledged for their valor against the pagan threats, with characters like Spiegelman and Sir Allen Page receiving awards. As tensions simmer, the discussion shifts back to Russel. Despite his father's past dishonor, it's revealed that he has risen to the 5th circle in magic, provoking speculation that the King aims to elevate Russel as a hero while undermining the Archduke's faction.Overall, the blending of personal honor, political machinations, and the looming specter of past family reputations sets a rich backdrop for the narrative. The chapter closes with a quote implying the spectacle of Russel’s ascent, underscoring the challenges and complex loyalties at play in the kingdom."

Why, you ask?... You're exceptionally capable for your age.- Spoiling the joyous atmosphere, another character expresses concern about their condition, I still haven't fully recovered... I would’ve been the one to die.- Conversations turn serious as they discuss dragons, with intrigue about exploring the Flame Tower: It doesn’t hurt to be careful. Let's investigate it secretly.  During the banquet, characters reflect on achievements and recognition, with one remarking, You've done great things again... it's gratifying as your teacher. They acknowledge the presence of impressive figures like Sir Gillian, who mentions skills and offers support: If you ever need guidance, bring that ring and find me.  The king makes grand announcements, rewarding loyalty and courage with land and titles. Yet there is an undercurrent of rivalry: What’s displeasing you, Your Highness? Count Raymond is quite popular... leading to subtle court dynamics and thoughts on assertiveness in romantic endeavors.Overall, the chapter blends elements of camaraderie, political maneuvering, and personal growth against a backdrop of celebration, setting the stage for both conflict and character development."

Mal is determined to close the distance between him and Allen, stating, I’m going to keep drawing him into a corner. Meanwhile, Allen's skill is highlighted as someone exclaims, He’s a total monster. The stakes are raised with a proposal to conclude the ongoing wager, indicating that the spear tower will now be known as the blue tower, and both characters aim to reach the same level of power within three years.An intense duel is set up within a magical barrier, designed to withstand the might of both magic and swordsmanship. The dialogue showcases a recognition of the challenge ahead, as one character notes, There’s little difference in our skill right now. With emphasis on the importance of distance in combat, Mal acknowledges, This feels more like fighting a knight or a swordsman than a mage. As the battle begins, the extraordinary abilities of both characters are tested, revealing their confidence in firepower and resilience.The chapter concludes with a nod to the incredible speed and proficiency Allen possesses, with someone remarking, To think he could copy Allen’s formula in that instant. This sets the stage for an epic confrontation filled with dramatic revelations and intense magical battles."

The mentor observes, Your visual acuity and flexible thinking are good... but you don't seem to have a talent for wielding the spear, suggesting the protagonist has potential but needs direction. The protagonist expresses a willingness to learn in exchange for sparring with the knights: Alright. In exchange, I have a request.As the knights gather, they learn about Sir Russel's visit, who is rumored to have extraordinary abilities. One knight exclaims, Isn't Sir Russel the mage? Rumor has it he has horns on his head and breathes fire. The lord announces, Starting today, you all will have two sparring matches with Sir Russel, creating excitement and apprehension.Sir Russel eagerly participates, saying, Well then, shall we start sparring right away? The sparring is structured to push the knights, especially focusing on improving their skills, regardless of potential disadvantages.Amidst the training, there is discussion about lineage. A character wonders, That means there must've been a high-ranking dragon among the ancestors of the Raymond family. This revelation adds to the intrigue surrounding the protagonist's heritage.In a critical part of the spar, the protagonist reflects, If it weren't for my battle experience with Hugh, breaking through this would have been tough. The chapter culminates in intense sparring sequences, with the protagonist realizing, I can't believe he defeated me easily, highlighting the challenges ahead and the importance of continued training.Overall, the chapter focuses on mentorship, the growth of the characters through challenging sparring, and the lore surrounding their abilities and lineage, presenting a blend of action and character development."

One character advises the protagonist about visiting the White Magic Tower Master, a half-blood from the fairy race, who may provide crucial information regarding entry into the dwarven realm. As they prepare for the research trip, another character, Russel, enters the scene. It's revealed that he too applied for the underworld trip, and the two express excitement about not being lonely on their journey. Discussion arises about the eccentric nature of the White Tower Master, and the anticipation builds as they prepare to meet her. There’s a sparring scene where certain knights are in disbelief at Russel's strength when he draws against a second-grade knight, revealing the competitive and respectful martial culture among them. After the sparring, a mentor offers Russel books on spearmanship, leading to a discussion about the merits of different techniques. Russel is torn between two highly regarded books but eventually opts for a refined technique that focuses on flexibility over raw power, reflecting a strategic mindset typical of a mage. As training continues, he resolves to focus on perfecting his technique, acknowledging that there's no shortcut to becoming a third-circle mage.He also contemplates finding traces of dragons and explores old texts for potential locations, settling on the Red Molintain Belt Canyon and noting that Kuuril Island seems more promising for his quest. The chapter concludes with Russel feeling the weight of his training and the quiet determination to uncover ancient secrets."

Although she is exploring her identity as a second-generation dragon, she hasn't yet realized her mission. The Dragon Lord expresses intrigue over the elf's awakening and the potential of her true power, noting that she no longer calls him Dragon Lord. The elf reflects on a silver light she felt before losing consciousness, revealing a connection to the Dragon's essence within her. As she prepares to depart and meet her companions, she receives blessings from the Dragon Lord, who indicates that time is running short for him.The narrative shifts to a poignant conversation between the elf and a spectral representation of the Silver Dragon, who advises her to act quickly. The Silver Dragon, recognizing her spirit is fading, shares that he wishes he could talk longer. Despite the melancholy, he entrusts her with the power of a divine horn, hinting at the legacy and responsibility she carries.The elf contemplates the powers tied to her ancestry, expressing a desire to understand their elements before claiming them.

They express excitement about their improved understanding of the King's Horn Wind Essence, feeling lighter and more powerful with every swing.Later, the protagonist receives a visitor, where a conversation unfolds about their recent adventure to the Underworld, addressing curiosities about its culture and weapons. They also respond to a long-awaited notification regarding Princess Hekate Rathmos and a reward involving mana stones and rings.As the conversation shifts back to their magical growth, they note, “Finally, I’ve become a Th-Circle Mage!” and describe the powerful sensation of mana flowing through them. They are rewarded not only with a new item, a debuff immunity artifact, but are also encouraged to continue striving forward as their mentor praises their progress.The chapter culminates with the protagonist recalling the dangers of giant monsters they faced during an expedition, realizing the destructive power they now possess yet remaining cautious of their rapid advancement. The excitement to test their newfound skills is palpable as they continue their journey."

One character marvels at the mage's level of magic, hinting at the significant power dynamics at play, while another expresses concern over the engagement's political motivations. Dialogue reveals a backstory about a historical savior and a plot to suppress that knowledge for future generations.The royal family’s excitement is juxtaposed with a grim plot involving excavations in the forest and the potential chaos caused by rampaging creatures, suggesting a deeper strategy to destabilize the kingdom of Endimion. Amidst political maneuvering, there's a light-hearted moment when a character teases another about their stiff demeanor, revealing a complex web of relationships and hidden agendas.As the engagement ceremony approaches, characters prepare for the event, discussing etiquette and the importance of showcasing royal power.

Saeron, the Prince of the Golden Sand Dunes, attends an engagement ceremony and proposes an alliance, hinting at the strategic military advantages it could bring against an empire's threats. Congratulations on the engagement of the century, Saeron says, revealing his smooth yet calculating nature. While engaged, Colint Raymond reflects on the unexpected kinship developing between them, despite the nobles' usual animosity in political affairs. I'd like to make an alliance with you, Colint Raymond, Saeron insists, emphasizing the importance of mutual benefit over mere political posturing. Colint acknowledges the weight of their engagement and its demands, addressing the fatigue setting in after a long day filled with expectations. The three days felt really long… It’s no surprise that you’re tired, he confesses.As they unwind, conversations flow about their respective roles, obligations, and the connections they’re forming—especially after Colint discovers a request letter for research outside the territory. Grateful for Saeron's consideration, he reflects, I guess this is why people get married.The chapter shifts as the intrigue deepens, revealing a subplot with Carl Neyman, a mage, and Aidan Owl, an RD-Circle Mage, who share a camaraderie through drinks and camaraderie, suggesting an impending challenge. You were in cahoots with the pirates? Aidan confronts Carl, revealing that danger looms near.The tension escalates as Aidan feels the presence of pirates, sparking a fierce ultimatum from a mysterious source: Go to the pirate ship now, unless you want to die! This unexpected twist sets the stage for further confrontations and alliances, ensuring the next chapter will delve deeper into the intrigue surrounding mage politics and pirate threats."

They engage with the bartender, asking about the ominous river of flames. The bartender clarifies that the volcanic activity nearby, although dormant, still exists and reassures them that it won’t erupt soon.As the protagonist seeks deeper knowledge about the magical landscape, they consider hiring a guide, and the exchange hints that there are schemes at play, possibly involving pirates seeking to ambush them. The protagonist is almost caught off guard by the potency of an artifact being used, revealing a brewing conflict with pirates in the area.Meanwhile, the protagonist helps a character named Aidan, ensuring he recovers from a drug's effects by infusing him with fire energy. Aidan expresses gratitude and mentions valuable research he possesses regarding potions, leading to a potential collaboration, especially when the protagonist hints at access to funding from the Flame Tower.The chapter closes with a transition as Aidan decides to follow the protagonist and their next objectives, including navigating new instructions from a recently acquired map emerging from their exploration of Kulil Island, and hints at the adventures that await them, including a destination where the rivers of ice and flames converge."

They express frustration at not being challenged during their fights over the past few days, indicating a sense of urgency for something significant to happen. A mysterious outsider appears, which raises suspicions—who could be looking for them? The protagonist reflects on the trust needed in this treacherous environment and ends up following the outsider into a dubious situation. It becomes clear they have odds to settle, and the nature of their connection with their environment is complex, as they navigate various guides and potential traps.The discussion reveals that a potential location of interest lies in the inner ring, where aggressive inhabitants dwindle the chances of an outsider's safety. The protagonist acknowledges their fighting spirit as a beastman, leading to a confrontation that showcases their strength against the odds.After a significant fight, the protagonist successfully demonstrates impressive magical prowess, even overwhelming their opponent in a single move, but sustains injuries themselves. Despite their loss, both parties exchange insights. The protagonist learns about a place where the rivers of ice and flames overlap, which may hold the secrets they seek.Intrigued by the mention of the Divine Region, a sacred area associated with a god, the protagonist resolves to explore this lead further, motivated by past encounters connected to a legendary figure. The chapter concludes with a sense of anticipation for the journey ahead, as the character reflects on their recent battles and the mysterious paths they must still uncover."

They discuss the trial’s brutal requirements: surviving without food while fighting five powerful warriors each day. Among the characters, there's a palpable tension regarding an outsider aiming to prove himself worthy by attempting the trial.As the protagonist approaches the canyon, they sense a dark, extraordinary energy, reminding them of past legends like Jormungandr, the serpent that brought destruction. Meanwhile, discussions unfold among tribes about a recent upset in the battle hierarchy, where respected warriors have been defeated. Amidst this background, admiration for the outsider grows. Some express disbelief at his strength, while others caution against underestimating him; they acknowledge his potential to elevate the stagnant fighting spirit of the Beastmen.When the outsider, Count Russel Raymond, finally meets the Beast King, they navigate tense etiquette. Russel reveals his aim is to discover a sacred place linked to their ancestors. This revelation incites unrest, as the Beastmen view such ambition as an audacious disrespect to their traditions. However, it's hinted that if Russel can prove himself in the Warrior's Trial, he might earn the right to enter the Divine Region, where only warriors are permitted.In summary, the chapter encapsulates themes of ambition, the tension between outsiders and ancient traditions, and the rigorous proving grounds that define the right to access sacred realms."

One character expresses frustration about not being able to continue, though they acknowledge the impressive performance of another. “Unfortunately, it doesn't look like you can carry on anymore, one character says, indicating a tough battle. Meanwhile, another character recalls, “I was trying to show you the passionate traces that Yoli left on my body,” hinting at a deeper connection formed during the fighting.As tension mounts, one character confronts another about strength, asserting, “I’m not that shameless; if you can withstand five of my attacks, then you pass the warrior's trial.” This leads to a sense of excitement and competition, with thoughts of the Beast King joining in on the fight stoking players' fires: “This is a little unfair for the Beast King to join in the fight.”Throughout the chaos, one warrior showcases his resilience, having fought twenty opponents and emerged unscathed. “To think his mental strength is that strong… incredibly skilled too,” observes another, a testament to the intensity of their battles.Ultimately, as the trial progresses, they find enjoyment in the strength displayed, with one declaring, “Interesting! Very interesting!” as they grapple with powerful moves and a formidable enemy. This chapter highlights the themes of resilience, competition, and the thrill of combat in their world."

One character questions another's sanity, remarking on their reckless decision to jump into a sulfur spring in search of the crystal. The response reveals that Fenrir's remains were indeed present, and a mission to pass on Fenrir's will to the Beastmen is discussed.As they exchange banter, it becomes clear that one character feels a surge of power from the crystal, suggesting an intense connection to it. They soon learn that a corrupted will of Fenrir has been purified, granting them extraordinary fiery energy. This new power overwhelms the character momentarily, leading to questions of their capabilities and a sense of destiny lingering in the air.Another character expresses a desire to inherit this newfound power and questions the reason for the Beastmen being isolated on Kulil Island. They speculate about the strength discrepancy amongst different races and the significance of the Moon Crystal in breaking the so-called shackles that bind them.The dialogue hints at a deeper lore regarding Beastification and Moon Seaification available during full moons, showcasing the urgency behind their mission to unleash the Beastmen’s full potential. By the end, the excitement around the discoveries is palpable, setting the stage for more action and revelations in their quest."

""]]","In this chapter, the dialogue revolves around the significance of a necklace made from the Beast King's canine tooth. One character expresses surprise and regard for the gift, which raises questions about the sincerity of the Beast King. As discussions progress, intentions for future interactions with the Beastmen are revealed, alongside the implications of Count Russell Raymond's contributions to the Kingdom of Endimion. He is honored with a new title and granted a reward, leading to inquiries about the true nature of his relationship with the Beast King.Tension builds when the Beast King proposes a partnership with Endimion, suggesting a willingness to bow to the king if necessary. This sets off conversations about territorial arrangements for the extensive number of Beastmen. A strategic discussion arises that highlights the potential military benefits of an alliance, but skepticism lingers regarding the true motivations behind the Beast King's request.As the chapter progresses, characters debate the Beast King's strength, with comparisons drawn against formidable figures within the kingdom. This leads to personal reflections on training and the significant disparity in power. Ultimately, the chapter closes with a determination to uncover the Beast King's true intentions, signaling that future interactions will be pivotal in shaping Endimion's political landscape."

One character expresses caution, indicating the potential risks involved in pursuing such knowledge, but also acknowledges the importance of learning.As they arrive at the Imperial Vault, they learn about its various sections, revealing that only one item can be taken out. The conversation shifts to feelings of jealousy and the impact of past events on their current situation. The king shares shocking news about the falsified reports regarding the Raymond household's territory, prompting feelings of regret and apologies from a royal figure.They delve into a deeper understanding of magical history through a visit to the museum's sixth floor basement. Here, one character is overwhelmed by the numerous books available but struggles with the limitation of time for reading. They seek to enhance their mastery of earth magic, debating between memorization and deeper comprehension.The chapter concludes with the discovery of the significance of a particular book titled Transcendent Dream, which embodies the mastery and legacy of the founding mage. The mentor emphasizes the importance of rest alongside hard work, offering wisdom about the challenges of achieving mastery in such formidable magic. The chapter leaves a sense of anticipation, as the characters navigate the intertwining of knowledge, power, and personal growth."

You seem a bit formal tonight. Are you here just to laugh at me?**Tori:** Of course not. I’ve come looking for you about the sample of the artifact you’ve drawn much.They uncover that Tori’s ring, a crucial artifact, may possess a powerful connection based on its counterpart, the Jade of Clouds, which can potentially control the weather.**Green:** Climate control is definitely a big advantage, but it carries great risk.As they explore the ring's powers, Green realizes significant mana consumption might hinder their abilities. The duo contemplates using the Cloud Jade carefully, aware of its immense potential.**Tori:** I believe I have an idea of how to use it.Their conversation reflects urgency and curiosity as they agree to channel the artifact's power effectively without overexerting themselves.**Bismark:** Let’s start by looking for the Circle Mages and above at the Yellow Tower.With past successes nourishing their confidence, the chapter concludes with a sense of determination as Tori seeks wisdom about advanced earth magic, setting the stage for further adventures and discoveries in the magical landscape they inhabit."

These dots on the paper… constellations?” He realizes they must use a sky chart, tying it to their quest. Vafter agrees, remarking it’s bizarre that they received a sky chart instead of a normal map, considering the location shifts with the winds.Dariah expresses her concern for someone conducting overseas research, encouraging them to stay safe and periodically provide updates. They discuss the intensity of the sun in the Nadia Desert and feel the changes in the environment, quickly noticing something ominous stirring beneath the sand.As danger looms, one character shouts, “Spread out if you don’t want to die!” They prepare to face a monstrous entity, referring to it as a sandworm. Amidst the chaos, a plan surfaces to test a new magic, linked to ancient seals and the history of monstrous battles.Discussion shifts to the magic key responsible for sealing giants, revealing its significance and hinting at a deeper connection to royal family powers. As they continue, insights about their adversaries and potential threats emerge, with buildup to a climactic confrontation.In concluding moments, one character receives rewards for closing in on their mission, revealing “the footprints of the Earth Dragon,” which hint at secrets yet to unfold. The chapter wraps up with a sense of urgency and an impending challenge that awaits them."

Observing their environment, they say, “I don’t think it's got anything to do with pushing or pulling... a circle hole... WAIT... AH!” As they explore, they express confusion over a compass that has only one needle, pondering, “Why is there only one needle?” They learn their mission: “Arrive at the end of this place using the compass. However, you cannot use any mobility magic when in the air.”As they navigate through this dream-like challenge, they remark, “Nothing’s ever easy. I’ll break through it!” Later, they encounter someone named Ann Mashrin from the Curtberth Merchant Association, who thanks them for their help in a recent perilous situation, saying, “I would like to repay you for your help. Is there anything you desire?” The protagonist humorously requests, “Could I have one camel?” The two part ways as the protagonist decides to follow the compass direction, wondering, “Does that mean... I’ll meet you again soon, my master?” Meanwhile, they reflect on the ruins and their potential value, considering, “If these ruins are restored completely, I think there’ll be great value to research it... Spiegelman would be really happy.”The protagonist boldly explores further, noting that they have reached the deepest area, stating, “A gate... but a warp gate?” as they prepare to engage with the mysteries ahead."

Arolind, who has received the mission instead of Vermilion, reflects, History has changed, as he grapples with the newfound circumstances after eight years. Amidst a gathering of mages, there's anticipation for Sir Russell's arrival, with Count Rinkel confirming Hydra sightings. When they realize the Hydra might strike first, urgency escalates. Arolind insists, We will go fend off the Hydra! Please prioritize the evacuation of the citizens! They plan a coordinated attack, aware of the danger the creature poses. Meanwhile, in a different scene, someone reflecting on their journey realizes the difficulty of their journey and declares, This time, I feel like I’m being tested for my qualities. After facing challenges and failures, the character perseveres and aims to absorb a horn discovered from the Earth Dragon lineage, encountering issues as their mana becomes blocked. Concluding their time in daunting scenarios, they express resolve to improve saying, If the opportunity comes again, I won’t lose. The chapter ends on a note that tasks have been completed and their next destination will be to the Yellow Tower."

What will we do to the one who stole our gift and peace? We must fight it! We must defeat it! The call to arms is led by Captain Russel Raymond, who outlines the plan for the Hydra subjugation. Knights will be divided into two groups. You are to protect the mages while stopping the monsters from escaping, he instructs firmly.After a recent attack, Sir Allen is left in a critical state due to poison from the Hydra: How is he? He's in bad shape... we must save him. This prompts uneasy discussion about the Hydra's capabilities. A five-headed Hydra means it's a newborn... it possesses potent poison!As Russel examines the situation, he finds a possible cure for Allen's poisoning. I need everyone to leave the room... I can burn the poison away or purge it out. Tension rises as they prepare for the difficult process of treating Allen, knowing there's a chance of him getting poisoned again.At the same time, preparations for the subjugation continue, despite the heavy burden of the task ahead. With thousands of monsters to face and the swamp hindering us... Russel remains determined. We need to depart in three days, he states, as he recalls the peaceful autumn from the previous year, reminding everyone of what they are fighting to reclaim. The fields, the smiles, the peace, he reflects, recognizing the stakes involved in their daunting mission against the Hydra."
