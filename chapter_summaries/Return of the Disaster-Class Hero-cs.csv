I won’t die until I kill those bastards who stabbed me in the back! he proclaims, revealing his unyielding spirit even in the face of despair.The world has been plunged into chaos due to a calamity that humanity has never faced before, described as a disaster that overwhelmed civilization itself. Despite their efforts, including the use of nuclear weapons, humanity's attempts to fight back were futile, leading to widespread destruction. They thought that the nuclear weapons were a bonfire, illustrating how dire the situation had become.Among the survivors are a group calling themselves the Thirteen Zodiacs, supported by divinely blessed humans, yet the protagonist stands out as a unique figure—the thirteenth human who awakened without such blessings. I did bet my life, I didn't 'sacrifice' myself, he insists, indicating that he has more to fight for than mere survival. As the chapter unfolds, it becomes evident that he was betrayed by one of his own, who left him for dead. One of the bastards that I thought had run away stabbed a dagger in my back, capturing the betrayal that fuels his fury. Despite severe injuries, including a severed arm, he refuses to succumb to despair, stating defiantly, There’s no way I’ll die like this.The chapter encapsulates themes of survival, betrayal, and the burning desire for revenge, establishing the protagonist's resolve to rise from his current predicament and confront the adversities ahead."

Obrashanhyung is confused and questions whether he imagined a snake that no one else seemed to see. He realizes he has super regeneration powers that healed his body after a brutal attack, which ignites a desire for revenge against the traitorous Saints. He exclaims, I’m already getting excited by just thinking about torturing... Meanwhile, significant changes are happening in the outside world, as the Demon Tower, a once-imposing structure, collapses, raising questions about Lee Geon’s fate.

Meanwhile, other characters marvel at Obrashanhyung's power, noting how he dispatches formidable orange-class calamities with ease. Conversations among them reveal skepticism about the nature of his abilities and origins. “What are you? You don't seem like a normal person,” another character asks, hinting at the mystery surrounding Obrashanhyung.In lighter moments, they discuss their appetite, with Obrashanhyung humorously demanding food after a shocking meal at a fast-food joint. More revelations come as he questions his own identity and magic powers, leading to the exciting development where he discovers he can utilize the powers of Ophiuchus.The chapter blends tension, mystery, and humor as it delves deeper into the complexities of power, identity, and revenge."

Dialogues reveal Hangouts filled with frustration and anger, as characters call out others as losers and “roaches.” The mention of Lee Geon's status sparks heated arguments, with one character expressing disbelief over Geon's rumored death and urging for his return, despite others dismissing the idea as nonsensical.Amid these discussions, a significant phone call shatters the status quo—Hugo receives news that suggests Geon's possible return, prompting him to abandon business in England for the airport. Characters reflect on Geon's legacy, debating his impact versus the achievements of the Saints who claim power in his absence. As the chapter unfolds, frustration mounts, culminating in a fiery declaration from one of the characters about taking revenge on the Saints. Meanwhile, ominous warnings suggest that they are being watched. The chapter ends on a cliffhanger, hinting at upcoming confrontations and an impending clash as household gods begin to intervene, indicating a brewing conflict among divine forces."

The protagonist retorts, emphasizing that he would have caused serious damage if he truly unleashed his powers. There's a realization that the antagonists possess divine artifacts, sparking intrigue and confusion among the characters about their origins and purpose, as “only saints should have them.”A character then explains the history of calamities that nearly led to humanity's extinction, revealing that divine gods and chosen saints saved them. As the conversation unfolds, they describe the hierarchy of disciples who now wield the powers granted by these gods. The protagonist learns about the ‘Ten Stars’ and the elite roles within divine cadres, pointing out the competitive nature of selecting disciples.Amid the chaotic revelations, there’s an encounter with the “household gods,” who are tied to these power struggles and command great respect. Just then, the protagonist witnesses a confrontation involving Yang Wei's goons, illustrating the ongoing dangers and manipulations at play.The chapter concludes with a sense of foreboding as the barrier around a powerful thug—the disciple of Gemini, an influential divine cadre—disappears. The protagonist contemplates the elite status of their opponents, remarking on their flashy attire and wealth, highlighting the disparity in power dynamics within this world of divine gifts and competitive discipleship. The narrative sets the stage for further confrontations and growth in this dangerous landscape."

A report warns of a calamity: the dreaded Spider Queen has re-emerged at a market in Bucheon. Sunghoon reflects, “Did it escape somehow?! It’d be hard for me to take on a red level calamity on my own…”As calamities are categorized by danger, the Spider Queen's presence triggers immediate concern. “If that Spider Queen has appeared, then the market is already... a ‘RED ZONE!’” Yang Wei commands to bury the market and mask the damage, ordering to “say that all the people there are dead.”Amidst chaos, Sunghoon encounters formidable foes and retrieves materials that enhance his strength, realizing he could become stronger than before. However, he clashes with a group that accuses him of ambushing their disciples. “Those badges are S-rank divine artifacts!” they shout, asserting his strength comes from stolen goods. Sunghoon retorts, dismissing the artifacts as merely ornamental.The situation escalates when a Divine Cadre Captain, Cho Sunghyuk, warns Sunghoon about the gravity of the Spider Queen threat. “Listen! All Gemini disciples in that mart! Exit the building immediately,” he urges, revealing that even Yang Wei has struggled against the monster. “We don’t have any way to stop him.” As the characters scramble to manage the catastrophe, it becomes clear the stakes are high, and secrets need to be buried to avoid further chaos."

Amid the chaos, one character expresses frustration at the suggestion to downplay the threat posed by the Spider Queen, arguing that doing so would erode the people's faith in the Divine Cadre. “I can’t leave him behind! Besides, there are still many people who weren't able to evacuate!” one hero insists, showcasing their commitment to not abandon friends and those in danger. However, the Divine Cadre Captain dismissively orders this hero to escape, highlighting a lack of empathy for those still trapped.As conversations unfold, the urgency grows with blocked exits and injured citizens. Characters realize they have two choices: either teleport to safety or face the calamities head-on. “We either have to use teleport, or get rid of all the calamities, someone laments about their dire choices.Then, a sudden crisis unfolds as a snake creature appears, and panic ensues with cries for help. Amidst all this, another character discovers evidence of a battle, leading to questions about who—or what—could have killed the Spider Queen. Speculation arises about an unexpected foe, hinting that a character from their past may be involved: “Is that Hugo bastard... the culprit behind all of this?”As the chapter closes, old tensions and rivalries resurface alongside the new threat, amplifying the stakes for the heroes as they struggle to protect their city and uncover deeper plots at play."

When did you come back to Korea?” They also mention the “Sagittarius Saint” in a somewhat reprimanding tone.Tension escalates as characters interact. One is shocked to discover that Lee Geon has indeed returned and inquiries about the events at the mart, specifically who defeated the calamity. A character lays claim that it was another named Lee Geon who defeated the formidable Spider Queen, creating confusion about the original Lee Geon’s whereabouts.The conversation reveals past connections and animosities, with accusations of impersonation and violent intentions surfacing. A character expresses rage towards another for attempting to impersonate Lee Geon and prepares for confrontation, revealing that they have been wronged in the past.As the chapter progresses, we see emergence of a power struggle. Lee Geon’s name evokes fear and astonishment, and it's hinted that he has come back with significant skills from his time in the Demon Tower. Despite disbelief, there's an acknowledgment of Lee Geon’s resilience. The dialogue captures the complexity of their relationships and the looming confrontations as one character recognizes the stakes involved, asking, “Are you… really… LEE GEON…?” The chapter ends on a cliffhanger, leaving readers anxious about the truth behind Lee Geon’s return and the battles that are sure to follow."

His encounter with the Divine God of Aries reveals the depths of his struggles and the transformations he's undergone. Geon initially surprises his companions with his survival, prompting a mix of disbelief and recognition, Wow, you finally recognized me! However, the situation escalates quickly as they question the sudden disappearance of a divine god, feeling a strong connection to the energy of Yang Wei, despite it being weak. Amid the chaos, Geon's obsession with a divine artifact he believes was stolen only adds to the heated confrontation. His humorous banter about his wealth contrasts sharply with the chaotic backdrop as he reflects on his journey. That bastard...he's so obsessed with looking rich, he muses, indicating his disdain for superficial appearances.Tensions rise further when allies chastise him for not reaching out sooner. A flurry of emotions leads to confrontations that mix camaraderie with frustration, revealing their complicated relationships. Lee Geon, you bastard... if you were alive, you should’ve come to me immediately! one ally exclaims, highlighting their deep concern for his well-being.As the chapter culminates, the arrival of the Divine God of Sagittarius – Apollo, injects yet another layer of complexity into the brewing chaos. Why’s he showing up here?! the characters wonder, setting the stage for further developments and stakes in their tumultuous adventure ahead."

Apollo, the Divine God of Sagittarius, is skeptical about the situation, questioning whether the mysterious appearances and attacks signify trouble. Geon, initially bewildered, harshly realizes that all his possessions, including his divine artifacts, have vanished. “First, let me hit you just once,” he proclaims in frustration, as he accidentally encounters the troublesome Pischu. The tension escalates when Geon discovers he's being pursued and expresses his irritation, suspecting that Yang Wei's vault has been looted in the process. With a plan forming in his mind, Geon declares, “I have a man with a plan!” He strategizes against Pischu, evoking a newfound power to identify weaknesses: “Alright then, let’s wreck havoc!” His confidence surges as he acknowledges his reckless past successes.As the chaos amplifies with Pischu unleashing its abilities to consume wealth around it, Geon realizes his own potential and asserts his dominance: “You wouldn’t have been beaten up if you’d stayed still.” The revelation that he has taken down a Household God leaves everyone astounded.In a striking turn of events, Geon manages to tame Pischu, declaring, “Hell yeah! Since it’s the Beast of Riches, I can use it to store all my treasures!” The chapter culminates with the transformation of a Household God into a companion, leaving them to ponder what led to this remarkable resurgence of Geon's power."

TRAITOR?! DO YOU KNOW HOW WORRIED I WAS FOR YOU?! expresses frustration over a supposed friend who married and started a family while leaving him trapped in a tower. Did you even think of finding your friend? he questions, revealing the deep hurt of betrayal. Sorry, I've said something unnecessary, the friend tries to ease the tension, directing the conversation towards the events in the tower. They discuss the chaos that ensued, including the resurrection of the deadly Crimson Eye and the devastating role of the tower's mysterious administrator, who could revive calamities. There’s a really sad story behind that, one character recounts how he was backstabbed and trapped among numerous monsters. After a fierce battle, he overcomes the administrator but collapses afterwards, uncertain if he actually died in the tower.Determined for revenge against those who betrayed him, including the one who backstabbed him, he contemplates preparing the necessary equipment for a fight. They brainstorm the creation of divine artifacts and how to use them against their foes, discussing the importance of gathering materials and utilizing their powers effectively.A declaration of war is sent out, igniting further tensions, especially toward those who failed in recent confrontations. You should have just stuck to selling good luck charms! one taunts those unsuccessful in battle, blaming their lack of performance on insufficient support.As news of a mysterious package containing a declaration of war unfolds, one character celebrates revealing a living, but not truly alive, individual. Strictly speaking, he's alive but not really living, causing confusion and alarm among their foes.This leads to a mix of preparation for fights ahead, a desire for revenge, and the unveiling of new abilities and artifacts, setting the stage for a brewing conflict between old friends and foes."

Characters open with a frantic dialogue as one exclaims, C-COULD THAT BE YANG? LET GO OF ME! RELEASE ME! indicating a struggle against an entity or person. Another character surprisingly notes their skills have improved significantly, allowing them to RESTRAIN YANG WEI’S SOUL.They quickly shift to investigating a treacherous blade associated with Geon's demise, speculating, “If you were stabbed, then it definitely wasn’t YANG WEI.” Jokes are made about drowning, but the mood shifts back to urgency as one character decides to visit the Divine Artifact Store, drawn by information regarding an engraving tied to the blade.Amidst their planning, discussions reveal there's a looming auction, THE Drachma Auction, which presents a significant opportunity – yet, other saints are also vying for valuable artifacts, with Lee Geon’s object becoming a focal point of competition. “Lee Geon’s divine artifact will appear in the Drachma auction,” sparks severe concern among the characters.Meanwhile, inside the Divine Artifact Store, characters engage in exchanges that reveal a complex web of relationships, with one acknowledging, “YOU MADE THIS?” and sharing knowledge about an SS-RANK appraiser involved with artifacts. The context implies a deep allegiance to Lee Geon, which is emphasized when an affiliate claims, “I’M HIS DISCIPLE THAT RECEIVED HIS FAVOR.”The chapter concludes with mounting tension, intertwining personal stakes with the greater conflicts of power and allegiance as they prepare for the upcoming challenges at the auction. The complex dynamics and character interactions pull together the narrative as they navigate their fates in an intriguing blend of humor and suspense."

It begins with one character questioning their memory of taking on a student, only to be impressed by the newcomer’s skills. There's a tense moment when they realize this student may have been troublesome before, and that they possess a powerful artifact that can evolve into a divine item.As the chapter progresses, attention shifts to the Saintess, who creates a stir upon her entrance. Characters speculate about her shift from church duties to interacting with them, revealing behind-the-scenes tensions relating to her perceived nature and the distrust surrounding her character. One character expresses resentment towards the Saintess, seeing her as selfish despite her public image as compassionate. The scene escalates with the discovery of overwhelming magic power that sends the Saintess into a panic, prompting her to leave hastily. This forces the remaining characters to confront their feelings about her and the implications of their intertwined fates. An urgent command follows to eliminate certain threats, highlighting the tension between personal vendettas and the looming need to sell their divine artifacts.Overall, the chapter captures the complexities of power dynamics, character relationships, and the intertwining of personal motives and divine will as chaos unfolds around the arrival of the Saintess and the mysterious student."

Lee Geon expresses gratitude, hinting at a future request. Meanwhile, ominous discussions arise regarding the Saintess, suggesting that she may harbor ill feelings towards Lee Geon. As mysterious water appears in a neutral zone, it is revealed to be linked to a battle skill that can replicate A-rank disciples, stirring alarm among those present.Amidst the chaotic scene, a conflict erupts as the followers of the Saintess confront Lee Geon. They threaten him, revealing they have orders to kill him. Lee Geon, unfazed, questions the reasons behind their aggression and mocks their fear tactics. The tension escalates when he effortlessly destroys a divine artifact with his bare hands, shocking his opponents who realize they are dealing with someone far more powerful than anticipated.As the battle intensifies, the enemies attempt to summon creatures to fight, but Lee Geon’s strength proves overwhelming, leading to swift defeats. One opponent, terrified of Lee Geon’s prowess, decides to flee, recognizing that facing him would lead to certain death. Amidst the chaos, Lee Geon gleefully collects materials from the fallen summons, reflecting on his good fortune.In a dramatic conclusion, Lee Geon and the remaining allies quickly realize that they must escape the battleground to avoid further confrontation, setting the stage for future encounters filled with tension and adventure."

Lee Geon confronts the Saintess, who has been shirking her responsibilities to treat those injured in a recent calamity. He admonishes her, saying, Hurry up and go save them! to which she bitterly retorts, Who cares if people like them die?! They should be happy that they saved me! As their heated argument continues, Lee Geon’s frustrations boil over, leading to a physical confrontation. The Saintess is bound and attempts to use her powers, declaring, I have an acidic protection skill that activates whenever someone strikes my body! However, Lee Geon's resilience shines through as he quips, Then this is my strong- you, before overpowering her skills, which she realizes are broken.The chapter delves into the nature of divine status, with Lee Geon explaining, Divine status is a godly power for the purpose of manifesting and maintaining... you can steal divine status when divine status falls. He reflects on the ramifications of his actions, noting that with each hit he delivers, his divine status increases, though it’s unclear which godly power he’s linked to.The chapter concludes with Lee Geon planning to head to an auction, passing off the Saintess to Taeksoo, further hinting at the web of intrigue and power struggles surrounding these characters. Amidst the chaos, it’s clear that their past animosities and alliances are far from resolved."

Sagittarius begins the conversation with a hint of animosity, saying, Leo, why are you here? Leo responds that he's there for an alliance requested by Aquarius and has business at the auction. This prompts Sagittarius to inquire about the real purpose of Leo's visit, leading to a realization that they are both interested in Lee Geon's divine artifact set to appear at the auction. Still collecting the divine artifacts that Geon makes? Sagittarious accuses, digging into Leo's insecurities about Geon's strength. Suddenly, chaos breaks out as a member rushes in to announce trouble—Gemini is buying all of Lee Geon's items. What did you say?! Sagittarius exclaims in frustration, realizing they have bigger problems at hand. Leo decides to leave the confrontation and focus on the auction instead, not wanting to waste time with Aquarius or Sagittarius anymore.As the auction progresses, there are offers of drinks and drunken antics, with one character jokingly needing to settle his bills, which leads to a brief moment of camaraderie. Despite this, there are still underlying motivations tied to power dynamics and the desire for authority, as shown when a character suggests another join them in service to the powerful Saint Aries, offering temptations of rank and wealth.When tension mounts over a recent purchase of Lee Geon's divine artifact, Sagittarius finds himself in the thick of it, exclaiming disbelief and indignation over the situation. It looks like we should not mess with items that Steven is obsessed with, one character warns, indicating the stakes have risen even further.Overall, the chapter delivers high-stakes banter mixed with schemes, showcasing the complexities of alliances and rivalries amidst the backdrop of an auction buzzing with hidden agendas."

Characters engage in heated dialogue about a newcomer who mistakenly took the artifact, prompting a response from the divine cadre captain, Cho. He's planning on saving billions by using a mistake as an excuse? one character exclaims, indicating the high stakes involved.As the situation escalates, they challenge each other's courage and skills, with one character derogatorily commenting on the other's lack of intelligence despite their brute strength. The dialogue shifts to an upcoming auction, highlighting the significance of the divine artifact tied to a legendary event known as the Berlin Wolf incident, where a calamity once rendered even the strongest unable to combat it.Tension rises as a report comes in regarding a hero, Lee Geon, who had supposedly defeated the calamity. As characters express envy and frustration over Lee Geon's unearned glory, a dramatic reveal occurs: “Lee Geon has returned alive!!” The revelation sparks a mix of admiration and resentment among the onlookers, particularly about the artifact he brings back—a relic now associated with legendary power, prompting one character to greedily mention, This is the thing that will make me the strongest! Thus, the chapter intertwines themes of rivalry, ambition, and the burdens of heroism in a world saturated with divine artifacts and their consequences."

The chapter begins with characters expressing disbelief at the artifact's iconic status, with one exclaiming, MY WORD! TO THINK I'D GET TO LAY EYES ON IT! The tension rises as panic ensues about it falling into the hands of trash, hinting at a looming conflict. A character urgently calls for help from the Divine Cadre, saying, “DO SOMETHING! I’LL CONTACT THE DIVINE CADRE HEADQUARTERS IMMEDIATELY!”  As the bidding begins, shouts of outrageous bids fill the air, I WILL BUY IT FOR BILLIONS! The bidding spirals into absurdity, reaching AN UNBELIEVABLE BILLION DOLLARS! Eventually, amidst the chaos, Steven Marker, known for his collection of Lee Geon’s artifacts, secures the Big Bone, claiming it with delight: “CONGRATULATIONS! THE GREAT LEO SAINT, STEVEN MARKER-NIM!  However, disaster strikes as the magic tower begins to crumble under the weight of the excitement, prompting desperate calls from characters urging everyone to GATHER OUR STRENGTH! In a frantic effort, they realize the dire situation with debris falling from above and panic sparks as “THEY WERE BURNT TO ASHES IN AN INSTANT...”  The chapter closes with ominous foreshadowing, hinting at greater peril ahead as a voice cries out, “OH NO, THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE?! This blend of auction frenzy and impending disaster propels the story into a climactic cliffhanger, leaving readers eagerly anticipating what comes next."

Oh, feeling uneasy, reassures him about his capabilities and confronts an approaching threat. He warns the others not to disrupt his performance against Big Bone.As the battle intensifies, Geon and Oh realize they’re up against a formidable foe using a powerful royal skill, rendering their usual attacks ineffective. Frustration builds when they discover the opponents they face are victims of the calamity’s mind control, being used as hostages to hinder their assault.Geon suggests they need to confront the calamity head-on, despite lacking a clear plan, and when asked if he's prepared to jump into the fray, he asserts that he will handle it regardless. Oh encourages him, indicating their resilient spirit in battling against the odds. The chapter concludes with a climactic build-up, showcasing their determination to overcome the calamity together."

A conversation about divine power reveals that it’s tied to a special skill requiring charge, which intrigues him as he considers trying it out.The tension escalates when another character feels overwhelmed by the formidable opponent, and the revelation of a powerful skill turns the tide. However, disbelief sets in as another discovers that their ultimate skill was overcome. The chapter climaxes with a confrontation, where a former adversary, seemingly enjoying the situation, exposes their identity and taunts, alluding to a past conflict. The characters prepare for the next phase of their battle, hinting at a complex web of relationships and rivalries that will unravel as they push forward."

He’ll survive one way or another,” someone remarks, showcasing a pragmatic attitude toward their current situation. They seem to have escaped a trap but recognize that they are still in danger. “Look at how happy they all are,” another responds, pointing to the tension but also some relief in their ranks.Sungjae, a strong young ally associated with Gemini, enters the scene, and there's palpable concern about him being involved with a certain disaster-prone figure. “Did you really get caught up with Ze I Walking Disaster?” someone exclaims, revealing fears for the safety of loved ones. There are tensions about involving the Gemini again, with one adding, “You should be sick of those Gemini guys already!”The chaos continues when a divine artifact causes unexpected complications: “The incredible ability he’s shown up to now… and that rough magic!” As suspicions about Geon's true identity arise, the stakes heighten, revealing intricate connections among the characters.Meanwhile, at the United States Leo Divine Cadre Headquarters, conversations swirl around the disappearance of the Castellan and the search for them. “The Gemini are known for their detection abilities,” someone asserts, indicating a willingness to bargain with them, despite past conflicts. As mistrust amongst the ranks grows, “Why should we look for that bitch?” expresses anger towards the situation.The Saintess Sophie Mardi's unexpected absence complicates matters further. “A terrorist attack?! What do I do?” one character wonders, torn between revealing unsettling truths and facing potential backlash from other saints. “If I don’t do anything, Lee Geon definitely won’t just sit still...” The chapter closes on a worrying note, hinting at brewing troubles and untold ramifications from the chaos surrounding them. In summary, the chapter centers on alliances, hidden identities, and the dread of looming chaos as characters navigate through threats and brewing conflict— with Lee Geon looming as a central figure who could shift the power dynamics in place."

The dialogue reveals a mix of tension and humor as they interact with one another.A character, possibly the main protagonist, taunts another, saying, You’d do that pretty good for a human. I’ll take you in specially as a pet. This sets a playful yet competitive tone. Someone else remarks on the situation, questioning, Why are all of you playing with fire? suggesting that a dangerous confrontation is underway. There’s also a mention of creating divine artifacts, indicating a deeper magical context. A blacksmith character, rather than a magician, reveals, You have suppressed the... skill data, discussing the necessities of acquiring skill data for crafting purposes.As the action escalates, there are threats exchanged: I’ll burn you for real if you touch Sung Jae! exhibiting protectiveness among the characters. An uncle figure assures his support, saying, Your uncle's got your back! which invokes feelings of family loyalty amidst the turmoil.Amid the chaotic battle, a character recalls a hero from their past, noting, That guy is Lee Geon... he’s way too handsome! This reflects nostalgia and admiration in the midst of crisis. Additionally, there are humorous moments, as one character awkwardly asks for an autograph, and another humorously comments about a character’s affection. Finally, as the situation intensifies, there’s urgency with All citizens, please evacuate immediately! showing that their circumstances are dire but tinged with personal motivations and relationships.Overall, the chapter mixes comedy with action and touches upon themes of family, loyalty, and the passage of time, while hinting at character development and emerging bonds among the cast."

As the conflicts unfold, a fierce battle transpires. Flames ignite as one character, having survived a fiery pit, exclaims, “Now that I’ve got some of these flames, there’s no reason to hold back!” He unleashes a powerful forging flame, which allows him to summon a production hammer for strengthening.The scene escalates when a character questions the outrageous power of his opponent, acknowledging the danger of their foe, a red-ranked fantasy beast. A mix of bravado and determination leads to the climactic moment where he blocks an attack with a simple “vinyl glove,” which surprises the beast. “You blocked my Hellbound with a mere vinyl glove?” the enemy responds in disbelief.Amid the chaos, the protagonist muses, “This is more useful than I thought,” indicating newfound strength. They prepare for an intense showdown, empowered by both magical flames and their own resolve, as the chapter closes on a note of escalating stakes and fierce battles."

The chapter opens with a comedic interaction about the usefulness of a vinyl glove, where one character exclaims, WOW THIS IS MORE USEFUL THAN I THOUGHT! This quickly spirals into an intense confrontation with a creature dubbed the Calamity Hell Lizard, which becomes a reluctant servant, humorously named “Torch” by the protagonist.Sungjae checks on her uncle, expressing concern for his well-being and hinting at a significant revelation after dealing with the calamity. She confronts him about the sacrifices made during the Demon Tower incident and questions the claims that he willingly sacrificed himself for humanity. Her uncle reveals, I was betrayed in the Demon Tower... by one of the Saints, shocking her.Sungjae is incredulous that the Saints, celebrated figures, would betray their greatest hero, suggesting that his excellence provoked envy. She realizes that he was isolated and denied the glory for saving humanity, leading to an emotional call to action: You don't have to cry. I’ll be paying this debt back a million-fold.Shifting scenes, a press conference is underway wherein a member of the Saints prepares to unveil the truth about the Demon Tower incident. The atmosphere is thick with anticipation as she states, The reason why I’ve come here... is to reveal the truth about the events of years ago. The audience grapples with the implications of her statements regarding the real hero behind the subjugation of the Crimson Eye.The chapter culminates in an explosive revelation. The audience, already suspicious of the Saints' narratives, faces the possibility that they have been living a lie. IF IT'S BEEN THE SAINTS! LIE THIS WHOLE TIME... THEN HOW CAN THAT BE POSSIBLE? The stage is set for an unraveling of deception, promising high stakes in the chapters to come."

The scene is filled with loud disruptions and accusations. Geon humorously notes, “Honestly, it's kinda fun watching this!” as he remarks on Cancer Saint’s exaggerated skills. Cancer Saint retorts with sarcasm about Geon’s supposed practice over the years, while Geon expresses skepticism about Cancer Saint’s true abilities. A fierce exchange ensues with Geon revealing that the clones Cancer Saint created are powered by the life force of the journalists in attendance. If harmed, the life force of the clones will dissipate, putting innocent lives at risk. “You filthy, stinking tactics of yours sure match your face,” Geon accuses, setting the stage for a tense standoff. Cancer Saint boasts of a new skill acquired from Drachma, allowing him to use targets as shields. The battle intensifies as Geon showcases his ability to perceive opponent weaknesses, revealing a critical flaw in Cancer’s core. “A large crack has formed in the power of the Cancer constellation!” he exclaims, recognizing the danger of the situation. The God of the Cancer Constellation is revealed to be uneasy, hinting at a shift in power dynamics.Despite the fierce encounter, Cancer Saint decides to retreat, ominously hinting, “I still have cards left to play.” Recognizing the persistent threat he poses, Geon prepares for the next round. Meanwhile, Oh Taeksoo bursts onto the scene, warning Geon that missiles are incoming, adding to the press conference's already heightened chaos. As the chapter wraps up, the sense of impending disaster looms, with Geon caught squarely in the chaos of battles and escalating threats."

Panic unfolds as the Mormot missile, targeting a populated area, is discovered. “Everybody in this area must immediately flee to the nearby shelter! THIS IS NOT A DRILL!” shouts a leader, emphasizing the urgency. With the situation dire, Gemini activates their teleportation abilities, urging, “You, me, and all those people down there are going to die, got it?!”Aquarius's Divine God, witnessing the tumult, expresses shock and frustration, cursing Lee Geon amidst the chaos. Meanwhile, amidst the power struggle, Sagittarius steps up, “I’ll send it all to you!” demonstrating their coordinated efforts to avert disaster. As they channel their combined abilities, “The missile and its fragments all disappeared!” cheers one character, reflecting a fleeting moment of victory.However, the chaos continues as the remnants of the missile threaten the Yin and Yang Palace, leading to confrontations within the Divine Cadre. With tensions high, a Divine Cadre Captain confronts another, “What are you doing with your authority... IS BEING ASSAULTED WITH THE FRAGMENTS OF THE MORMOT MISSILES!” The chapter closes with a sense of escalating urgency, highlighting the uncertain future ahead as the characters rally to defend their sanctuary from impending doom."

There's a growing unease as it's revealed they interfered with his accounts and have utilized his assets to fix the Palace of Yin and Yang, leaving it in ruins.As tensions flare, one character berates another for mistreating Oh Taeksoo, Lee Geon's proxy, calling out the inconsistency in their disdain towards a 'penniless saint' despite their own actions. “How dare you bastards treat him like that?!” Lee Geon defends him fiercely.The dialogue hints at an impending confrontation with the Purple Witch, who has summoned powerful magic, yet her efforts falter when Lee Geon emphasizes her failures, stating, “The purple witch's chance is gone.”The chapter ends with a hint of exploration, as Lee Geon plans to seek the whereabouts of the formidable Haize, suggesting that trouble is brewing and adventures await as he moves to confront unresolved issues. “I have a vague idea of where she is, so how about we go visit her?” he suggests, pivoting towards the next chapter’s potential conflict."

It starts with them discussing their food preferences, highlighting the group's dynamics and revealing some light-hearted tension. As they shift focus, a sense of urgency kicks in regarding the absence of Taeksoo-ahjussi, who is delayed due to a task he's been assigned.The conversation quickly turns into an interrogation about a missing purple witch, with tensions escalating. There's a revelation of the witch being trapped, likely at Sungjae's location, setting the stage for the chapter's conflict. Raeliquin's capability to utilize spiritual possession to confirm the witch's whereabouts is discussed, but unforeseen complications arise when a statue—integral to her possession—breaks, putting her in jeopardy.Amidst the crisis, the characters grapple with their allegiances, especially Raeliquin, who struggles between her loyalty to the Gemini cadre and her admiration for Lee Geon, viewing him as her hero. This internal conflict adds layers to her character as she fears the repercussions of her association.As the chapter closes, a brewing conflict emerges, urging Sungjae to take action against Lee Geon, who is portrayed as an enemy both fearsome and treacherous. The stakes heighten as the divine powers at play intensify, culminating in a chaotic scenario where the characters must navigate their relationships and the looming threat around them."

Haredice Studio urges everyone to stop the conflict, but chaos ensues as it's revealed that magic power, vital for battling the calamities, has vanished. Why can't I gather magic power? exclaims a follower, while Captain Ken realizes the dire situation—communication is severed, and they can't contact other disciples. The gravity of Gemini's loss of magic is felt throughout, leaving everyone in a state of confusion and fear.Meanwhile, a sinister figure, Cancer, boasts about his abilities to sever relationships, even going so far as to say, I can even sever your contract with a Divine God! There’s a powerful acknowledgment of the risks involved. Freyja reacts to this challenge, expressing concern over Cancer's transgressions, but he seems unbothered and eager for confrontation with the Divine Goddess. I'm looking forward to that, he taunts, welcoming inevitable divine consequences.As the chapter culminates, the Divine God battles with newfound tools but struggles against Cancer's ruthless abilities. The chapter ends on a precarious cliffhanger as Freyja attempts to summon all her power to fight back, leaving readers eagerly anticipating the next move."

Dialogue reveals the severity of the situation, as characters plead with Freyja to halt her invasion, emphasizing that her actions are a significant breach of conduct. Freyja is confronted by the Gemini divine god and is informed that numerous entities oppose her interference. They express their displeasure with Freyja's attempts to strengthen her territory by breaking divine laws, leading to potential sanctions from other divine gods. The Gemini god, frustrated, hints at a brewing conflict with Sagittarius, who struggles against Freyja’s might and is backed by other gods.Meanwhile, Taeksoo reflects on Freyja's past actions against his ally, Sungjae, and vows vengeance. In a twist, he successfully retrieves a deed document from the highly secured Palace of Yin and Yang, revealing his skills in infiltration. The tension builds as characters discuss the implications of obtaining powerful commander spirits, culminating with a villainous confrontation where a character admits to using a formidable weapon and torturous methods.As the chapter closes, Lee Geon emerges smugly, taunting the abandoned Gemini spirits while their plight hangs uncertain. The stakes increase as the dialogue conveys a sense of impending doom and conflict, leaving readers eager for the next chapter."

No, I mean you can't do this to Geon-Samchon!” His family tries to calm him down, reminding him that despite their struggles, they care for him and even planned a surprise with his favorite cake: “We bought the Yirgacheffe coffee and the cake that you love!”The little ones express their admiration for Geon: “Good job! As expected of you, Sungjae!” and one proudly shares about a head pat received, indicating a bond of affection. Meanwhile, **Raeliquin** expresses frustration over searching for loopholes, leading to a discussion about their new household joining Geon’s: “We have finally joined Lee Geon’s household! Your newest household members are giving you high praise.”Throughout the chapter, the characters grapple with the looming threats from the “unknown civilization” and their own internal conflicts. They acknowledge the chaotic state of their world and vow allegiance to Geon as their leader: “Just as we know to kneel before you, Lee Geon-nim, we swear our lives and allegiances to you!”Humor and frustration blend together as characters react to misunderstandings: “Wait, what’s she saying? Propose?” indicating a lack of clarity amidst the chaos. Ultimately, the chapter concludes with a showdown brewing as Geon's emotional state draws the ire of a powerful enemy, Sagittarius, who grimly states, “I’m sorry, but you will die here.”The chapter encapsulates the struggle between personal relationships and the challenges posed by their world, setting the stage for conflict and resolution in future chapters."

Capricorn, confused and angry, demands to know what Leo did to his subordinates, who are under the control of Leo's potion, which makes them only respond to his flute's commands. Leo slyly offers Capricorn a chance to regain his control if he uses Lee Geon’s sword to side with him.Capricorn, feeling betrayed and skeptical, angrily responds, Why should I follow your orders? Leo tries to exploit their shared inferiority complex regarding Lee Geon, stating, We have something in common, don’t we? But Capricorn fiercely rejects Leo’s manipulative tactics, insisting he has resolved to surpass Lee Geon without resorting to dirty tricks.The confrontation leads to a clash of ideals, where Capricorn refuses to accept Leo’s offer, declaring, I don’t have the slightest intention of taking Lee Geon’s place by getting rid of him! Determined to prove himself, he defies Leo's claim that he can make him a weapon, saying, Would a weapon made by you be better than what Lee Geon made? In a heated exchange, Leo threatens that Capricorn will regret his decision, but Capricorn stands resolute, signaling a fierce battle ahead as both characters grapple with their ambitions and past traumas. The chapter concludes with the promise of a significant showdown between their philosophies and strengths."

I NEED TO GO OVER AND END THIS QUICKLY. He is clearly frustrated and anxious about the current situation regarding the Demon Tower and prophesies of doom, particularly concerning Geon.As discussions about the prophecy arise, Lee insists, JUST TELL ME WHO TRIED TO KILL ME! IN RETURN, YOU MUST GUARANTEE MY SAFETY. The urgency is palpable, as he prepares to face any adversaries.In a heated exchange, Lee argues with a Capricorn saint, declaring, “IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A NEGOTIATION YOU HAVE A HAND IN. This reveals a chaotic environment where trust is thin, and threats fly. The Capricorn saint's reluctance to return an important divine artifact creates more conflict, leading to Lee's anger at the situation.The chapter takes a turn when mysterious brothers are summoned. Lee commands, THREE BROTHERS, COME OUT, and invokes a sense of intimidation regarding their participation in the fight. In a moment of darkly comedic banter, one brother exclaims about using a weapon called the MORMOT, prompting confusion from Lee about its silliness.With captures and confrontations, Lee's allies find hope, whispering, “THEY WON’T ATTACK US ANYMORE, RIGHT? I THINK WE'RE GOOD...” But the situation escalates as they prepare for battle, proclaiming, “WE CAN ONLY KEEP GOING!”As the clash intensifies, Lee shouts, DIVINE ARTIFACT, HAMMER THAT GRANTS ACHIEVEMENTS!” suggesting tactical changes. The beasts respond bravely, boasting about their toughness, but Lee humorously questions their reliance on weapons.The chapter culminates with chaos and uncertainty, leaving readers eager to see how Lee and his crew will handle the challenges ahead."

""]]","In this chapter, Sungjae is advised to hide in the car until his father arrives to deal with a monster safely. Think of this as playing hide and seek, a voice reassures him, emphasizing the importance of waiting bravely. As Sungjae interacts with his sister, it’s revealed that he hasn't slept well due to restlessness about their upcoming visit to their mother. Despite his gloominess, she gifts him a divine artifact for his birthday, which he hopes will help him in his role as a Divine Cadre.Meanwhile, there's a tense discussion about disasters as Virgo has declared they can't eliminate a powerful disaster known as Blood Fog, which terrorized Korea a decade ago. There’s concern about missing personnel on the outskirts of the dome where dangers lurk, as the Virgo search squad's captain leads a mission despite the thick fog.In another location, Lee Geon is praised for defeating an octopus disaster, showing his increasing reputation and skill. Despite the accolades, Geon seems unimpressed, noting that his achievements are being exploited. He deliberates over a new trial that will test his abilities physically and intellectually and requires him to overcome specific challenges, including finding a disciple and a secretary.The chapter balances personal moments between Sungjae and his sister with larger stakes as multiple characters face looming threats, all while hinting at important trials and decisions to come for Geon."

The characters discuss the weapon storage of Virgo and speculate about the malevolent nature of the dagger and other weapons associated with it. One character reveals the tragic demise of their predecessor, who was murdered while investigating the dagger, indicating a strong connection to an unknown civilization’s disasters.As the conversation unfolds, it's highlighted that curses can nullify even the powers of divine beings, hinting at the catastrophic implications of the dagger's influence. The urgency of clearing a trial of strength is established, alongside the arrival of a train carrying troops, which introduces a sense of urgency and potential conflict.Sungjae's birthday is mentioned, revealing a personal touch amidst the chaos, as another character laments not knowing about it, reflecting on their bond with him. The underlying tension between faith and betrayal is discussed, especially regarding Virgo and its religious undertones, which is especially poignant given the events involving the dagger.The narrative then takes a turn toward an assignment concerning Sungjae's associations and his past, indicating that there's more to learn about his circumstances. The quest to access Gemini's Magic Library is introduced, where forbidden grimoires might hold crucial knowledge that could help decipher the dagger’s origins and the sinister motivations behind its existence. In the end, there's a revelation that similar daggers appeared in auctions, linking back to Virgo, indicating that the discovery of the dagger’s true origins is more intricate than initially perceived. The chapter closes on a note of intrigue surrounding the depths of magic and hidden knowledge waiting to be uncovered."

Sung Jae expresses gratitude for assistance, while others panic over the unforeseen disaster. Sung Jae and his friends are waiting for Jae Won to fetch burgers when the blackout strikes, leaving everyone confused and worried. They soon learn from a mysterious group that they are dealing with a dangerous entity known as the Blood Fog, a crimson mist that has already claimed countless lives. The gravity of the situation is compounded by revelations about the Celestial Lord and the urgency of a mission to confront the Blood Fog, as it represents a substantial threat not only locally but potentially worldwide.As they plan to confront this disaster, doubts arise over the motivations of the Virgo celestial forces and their leader, Kevin Ajar. Tensions escalate with the revelation that the Celestial Lord's wife, Chun Jiwoo, was lost to the very fog they are now confronting. Through the dialogue, we gather that this mission is not only a matter of duty but also a personal vendetta for some, intertwining their fates as they prepare to battle the Blood Fog. The chapter concludes with a light-hearted moment among the chaos when a character goes out to buy burgers, providing a brief respite from the looming threat."

The chapter opens with a hero desperately trying to save someone trapped inside a massive tree, pleading, PLEASE...SAVE.... A voice echoes with eerie urgency, hinting at a powerful entity involved.Sagittarius expresses frustration over his current state and announces he has freed others from the tree's grasp with his magic. He proposes a joint attack, rallying allies who have come together to face the growing threat. Despite their best efforts, they quickly discover the disaster can devour their attacks and regenerate, leaving them in a precarious situation. Libraries of reinforcement arrive, yet doubts loom over their ability to defeat this enemy.The team decides to use a teleportation strategy to banish the disaster, acknowledging it might return but prioritizing the immediate danger. Tension escalates when people scream for help as the disaster consumes a human, further complicating the hero's mission.

One character expresses deep regret, believing that if they had acted differently, things could have turned out better. Meanwhile, Sungjae continues to blame himself for the disaster, even as others criticize Sagittarius, who was unable to protect his family and the citizens during the crisis.The situation escalates as Sagittarius, Hugo, faces public wrath during a memorial service for the victims, where citizens lash out at him for his perceived incompetence. Despite the distressing circumstances, some characters try to justify the need for accountability, believing that it could pave the way for divine intervention in Korea.Tensions rise as critical dialogues emerge about the possibility of retrieving lost souls from the Blood Fog. Hugo, despite feeling responsible for the disaster, expresses his determination to save the victims, recognizing the emotional burden on their families. A fierce debate ensues about the limits of power and responsibility among the Saints, highlighting the complexities of their roles during crises.As the chapter concludes, it becomes evident that the emotional weight of the tragedy doesn't just affect public perception but also the personal struggles of those involved, including Hugo, who feels the need to redeem himself and protect the remaining family members. The chapter encapsulates themes of guilt, accountability, and the relentless pursuit of hope amidst despair."

YOUR LEFT ARM HAS BEEN DAMAGED, warns a voice, hinting at Geon's struggles. As he grapples with his injuries, the revelation of the Blood Fog's effects on his powers becomes dire: “THE CALAMITY, BLOOD FOG, IS DECREASING PHYSICAL ABILITIES.” Despite the setbacks, his regeneration kicks in: “LEFT ARM HAS BEEN RESTORED.”As Geon senses the approaching darkness, he recalls the fearsome Demon Tower, filled with calamities that were “IMPOSSIBLE TO RAID.” The urgency grows as he declares, “WE NEED TO DESTROY THE DOME! IT’S BEING USED AS A PRISON, HOLDING ALL THE PEOPLE INSIDE.” The realization that the dome is a food source for the Blood Fog ignites a fierce determination within him: ALL SAGITTARIUS FORCES, FIRE AT THE DOME!Amidst this chaos, he confronts a troubling truth and lines of tension surface between him and another character, with accusations flying: “I TOLD YOU NOT TO UNLEASH IT HERE!” The implications of past sacrifices and a heavy guilt weigh down on their conversation, as Geon struggles with bitter revelations about his own role in previous catastrophes.Determined to rectify the situation, Geon strategizes to gather resources and harness the grimoires to potentially fight back against the Blood Fog, leading to a frantic plan to teleport to Europe where the calamity looms. The stakes are high as Geon realizes time is running out: “WORRYING IS ONLY GOING TO WASTE TIME.”As the chapter closes, the tension between characters and the looming threat continues to escalate, leaving readers eager for the impending confrontation."

They recognize the power wielded by an enemy, exclaiming, It's using the Sagittarius power that it stole from me like its own! The ongoing battle intensifies as allies struggle to maintain their footing, with one ally saying, I somehow managed to survive, but... it will be a little hard for us to continue!” Tension grows as they face off against the sinister forces at play, warning of the approaching wicked energy.In essence, the chapter is a high-stakes reflection on power, desperation, and the determination to overcome personal struggles while confronting a powerful adversary."

One character defends TaeKsoo, expressing that he may not be the smartest, but he definitely isn't weak and should not be underestimated. Suddenly, a massive column of fire erupts, illuminating the night as a sign of turmoil in the ruins. As the characters witness the chaos, it is revealed that TaeKsoo has regained his lost powers, bringing a sense of relief. One character vents frustration at the Frog's gluttony, stating, Too bad for you, Frog! You wanted to devour everything, but you couldn't take anything from us! Despite the desire to eliminate the Frog, they acknowledge that someone else must take on the burden. After the battle, they discover the ruins of the Frog's core, now turned to ash. Hope is rekindled with the release of souls that the Frog had previously consumed, signaling that the victims will soon awaken. Sungjae's recent birthday is celebrated, albeit belatedly, amidst the chaos. One character experiences a moment of despair when contemplating death at the hands of a monster, but another encourages them to hold onto hope, reflecting on family ties and support even in dire situations. They assess the condition of a fallen friend, speculating on their potential recovery after being engulfed by the Frog. As the chapter progresses, a sense of camaraderie and determination is established.

The hospital said that people are waking up one by one, one character notes, confirming the hopeful news. However, it is revealed that two important figures, Jaewon and Jiwoo, have yet to awaken.Sungjae learns not only about the awakenings but also about the risks faced by his family and their allies. You should go back now, he is advised, emphasizing the urgency to see his mother and Jaewon. Despite the chaos, the characters express progress and hope for the future, highlighting the importance of their relationships.While conversing, there are hints at deeper issues. One character reflects, He intentionally put distance between you and him because he blamed himself for what happened, indicating the emotional burden they share. They also plan to bring flowers as a token of remembrance and care.Amidst their personal struggles, larger threats loom. One character states, People woke up... the victims of the Blood Fog incident, revealing the potential fallout if the victims start speaking out about their experiences. Tension rises as conspiratorial discussions emerge between characters concerned about being exposed.The chapter closes with a sense of impending conflict, as one character prepares to take drastic actions to cover up past mistakes, vowing, I'm going to Scorpio’s hospital... to get rid of those guys in the hospital beds. The narrative weaves together themes of hope, familial ties, and the shadows of deception as the characters try to navigate a world on the brink of alarming revelations."

He mentions that he has completed the Trial of Strength and must now prepare for the Trials of Fame and Intelligence, indicating a desire to progress further. Amidst their discussions, Geon discovers a shard linked to an ancient civilization, leading him to suspect Virgo is behind the recent troubles.Hugo lists his tasks while Geon contemplates the unresolved issues related to Virgo and Libra that need addressing. Geon is determined to seek justice for his family against those responsible for their suffering, exuding a fierce resolve. Tensions rise when Geon insists his allies return to Korea, believing they would be a distraction in his further pursuits against Libra, though he expresses a desire for one member to remain.Geon sets up a new ability, Gaze of a God, allowing him to create a subordinate from a candidate who proves worthy. This highlights his strategic mindset as he anticipates future conflicts. Meanwhile, a sudden confrontation occurs as Geon is confronted by Yoon TaeWoo in the hospital, escalating the situation just as Geon’s family regains consciousness.At the same time, the Europe Alliance's politicians discuss their missed opportunity regarding Lee Geon and the impending return of Virgo, pondering his reputation being damaged yet preparing for his comeback. The chapter builds an atmosphere of tension, anticipation, and determination as Geon prepares for the challenges ahead while facing enemies lurking in the shadows."

']]","In this chapter of Return of the Disaster-Class Hero, we open with a sense of disbelief as Lee Geon reflects on the unexpected power of his sword. I definitely swung my sword lightly just now. To think it’d have such power... His surprise escalates when he realizes the significant destruction surrounding him—the Virgo Sanctuary has exploded. Amidst the chaos, someone expresses confusion: Hi, my goodness, I came here because Lee Geon suddenly asked me to come here... but what's all this? It becomes clear that this is not just a simple battle; the stakes are higher with betrayal and calamity looming.As characters discuss the fallout, one laments, “Calamity ambush, driving a wedge between saints, internal betrayal... all plans have failed, huh?” Meanwhile, another expresses regret over underestimating Lee Geon's strength, stating, We never expected Lee Geon to defeat the undefeatables so easily...The tension rises as accusations fly—“Scorpio was the one that brought harm to Geon?” One character defends their ally, insisting, “I can’t say the same for others, but I’m certain Hayley wouldn’t do that!”The conversation continues, revealing the deeper intrigue, with discussions about dangerous artifacts and hidden enemies. “The unknown civilization’s dagger that you’re using as evidence... I discovered this. These are the items I found when I looked into Scorpio five years ago.”As confrontation looms, a character is told, “Stop him! All of you are to stop him!” Another comments on the return to a battleground, The link with the divine gods is back!Perio enters the fray, revealing his intentions. “I have urgent business with the Ferion right here.” A plot twist arises with offers and mission completions: “Perio, become a calamity and complete your mission too the end.”The chapter crescendos with humor amidst chaos as characters nickname each other and comment on the surrealness of their situation. “Hey, white hair. That guy’s name is Perio, right?” and “How about Great Perio?” The chapter concludes with Lee Geon's realization of his newfound strength, amidst the discussion of powers and their side effects: “I don't know how... but why am I overflowing with power?” As the physical strengthening process is completed, “The side effects of physical strengthening have disappeared,” hinting at great challenges yet to come as he adapts to his bolstered abilities."

Jaewon suggests they escape by making a contract, indicating a willingness to transfer to her Divine Cadre. Despite his reluctance, he acknowledges Chun Sungjae's connection to the First Fairy King, Elysion, and decides they must run.As chaos unfolds, Chun Sungjae confronts others who threaten his freedom. A spirit unexpectedly manifests, revealing itself as the mighty First Fairy King, stirring confusion among the characters. The Fairy King expresses a desire for Sungjae's incredible energy and contemplates switching allegiances.However, the scene escalates, with opponents ordering attacks on Chun Sungjae. In a surprising turn, Jaewon manages to stand up after years of inaction, revealing he received the blessing of Ophiuchus. Despite facing overwhelming numbers, he and Yooha turn the tide of the battle, causing their enemies to retreat.The chapter closes with a warm moment between Yooha and Jaewon, where she highlights his growth and hints at secrets involving a grimoire, while he deflects her curiosity, leading to her suspicion about his ties to Uncle Geon."

Yooha is anxious, but a proposal is made to combine their parties and use the teleportation station to expedite travel. “I’ll give you this teleportation scroll as a gift,” suggests Uncle Geon, easing Yooha's concerns. As they discuss logistics, it becomes clear that reaching Scorpio will be challenging due to blocked routes. George expresses his mission: “I can’t possibly let anyone defeat Lee Geon before I do.” As preparations to teleport kick in, they discuss Lee Geon’s arrival in Washington D.C., sparking plans for a grand welcome.Meanwhile, past confrontations surface as individuals discuss the “Blood Fog” incident tied to the Libra Saint’s sons. Accusations fly as it’s revealed that the true culprits behind the calamity were Yoon Taewoo and Yoo Shiwoo. The Libra’s authority is questioned as he claims ignorance of his sons' actions.“Make your choice quickly. What will you do?” demands Hugo, pressing Libra to take responsibility or face public fallout. The chapter delves into the burden of parenthood and choices, culminating in the introduction of a new mission: the creation of Ophiuchus’s insignia and the selection of its saint.As the chapter progresses, personal tensions bubble with concerns about safety, as well as the dynamics between characters, especially with Sungjae. A call goes unanswered, and Yooha's frustration escalates into a resolve to head to Korea immediately, feeling overshadowed by Sungjae's confidence.In the end, the narrative pivots toward the future, with invitations extended to join divine cadres and the power dynamics shifting as preparations are made to face forthcoming challenges."

REVEAL YOUR TRUE IDENTITY BEFORE I RIP YOU TO SHREDS WITH LIGHTNING, one character demands, hinting at a deeper past connection with Selvia, who retorts, LONG TIME NO SEE, SELVIA. YOUR ACTING SUCKS AS USUAL. The tension escalates as Selvia is accused of masquerading as Captain Oliver, shocking everyone with the revelation that CAPTAIN OLIVER WAS ACTUALLY A WOMAN.As the scene unfolds, accusations fly: GET YOUR FEET OFF ME! and SHUT UP OR I'LL STRIKE YOU WITH LIGHTNING! denotes the volatility of their exchange. There's a reference to past events shaking foundations, with one character lamenting how they lost a fight years ago, claiming it was sabotaged for money: WH-WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING? THE FIGHT HAS ALREADY STARTED!Amid the chaos, unexpected elements interfere with the event, with characters online struggling to maintain order: STOP THEM! STOP ALL THOSE PASTARDS THAT ARE TRYING TO JOIN THE FIGHT! The complications pile on as the audience itself turns into a wild card, further derailing the already strained anxieties of the fighters.Frustrations peak with the line, WHERE DID HE GO?! when a key figure goes missing, prompting others to strategize hastily—IT CAN'T BE HELPED, THEN. I'LL HAVE TO PROCEED TO THE NEXT PLAN... The dynamic of authority is questioned, setting the stage for potentially drastic actions in the upcoming confrontations, with threats of full power unleashed: “I'LL GO WITH MY FULL POWER FROM THE START!”Everything culminates in an atmosphere charged with uncertainty, anticipation, and the promise of a consequential battle on the horizon as hidden motives and identities gradually unravel."

The Vice Celestial Lord is urged to make a judgment: “What’s your decision?” to which he decisively declares, “THIS IS LEE GEON’S VICTORY—HE WON!” This announcement sparks excitement among the observers, particularly one who exclaims, “IM GLAD I PLACED MY BETS ON HIM! I STRUCK THE JACKPOT!” Yet, doubts linger regarding Lee Geon's capabilities, as another notes, “LEE GEON DIDN’T HAVE ANY DIVINE GOD YEARS AGO EITHER...ISN’T SOMETHING STRANGE HERE?”The scene shifts as tensions rise with the appearance of a hidden spy from Libra amidst the Leo divine cadre. Lee Geon confronts Libra, expressing disbelief at Libra’s presence: “HOW CAN THAT BE?! THERE WAS A LIBRA SPY HIDDEN WITHIN THE LEO DIVINE CADRE?!” Libra smugly responds, “LONG TIME NO SEE, LEE GEON,” mockingly alluding to mutual disdain and past betrayals.As they argue, Kevin laments, “YOU KNOW FULL WELL WHAT KIND OF PERSON LIBRA IS,” while Libra derisively questions their character. Accusations fly as Lee Geon denies any plans to involve himself further in Libra’s schemes, prompting Libra's retort about Kevin's inability to act decisively: “DIDN'T YOU GET BACK YOUR POWERS?”The chapter escalates as Lee Geon demonstrates unwavering strength, surprising everyone by defying expectations against the Zodiac Stigma—a powerful mark bestowed by a divine god. “YOU’RE MAKING A DIFFERENT EXPRESSION NOW! HE DESTROYED THE...ZODIAC STIGMA?!”The stakes rise as the divine authority of Saints is challenged, and the implications of these power dynamics stir intrigue among the ranks: “HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO DESTROY THE ZODIAC STIGMA OF ANOTHER DIVINE GOD?!” As the dust settles, Lee Geon emerges with newfound respect and power, setting the stage for future confrontations filled with tension, betrayal, and the question of divine influences in their world."

The atmosphere is tense, with Cheon looking more dazed than usual post-fight, and her companions expressing concern about her state after Lee Geon’s declaration of war against Libra. What's wrong? You don't seem yourself, a bystander notes, highlighting Cheon’s odd demeanor as spectators celebrate her continued winning streak. This prompts discussions about the recent brutal torture of Libra members, bringing forth mixed reactions—some find satisfaction, while others are rattled by the spectacle.As the comments traverse accusations against Libra for their alleged deceit regarding the Blood Fog incident, one character fumes, Libra has been deceiving the whole world! This provokes a deeper debate amongst the characters about the evidence—some believing the claims against Libra seem rushed without official statements from them, while others grow more suspicious of their silence amidst catastrophe.Tensions further escalate when Scorpio and Virgo engage in a retort about the medicines they’ve administered to Lee Geon. It's tonic medicine,” Virgo defends against Scorpio's insinuation, indicating a battle of wits during their chaotic attempts to manage Lee Geon.Amidst the chaos, Lee Geon seems to be busy plotting his next moves, indicated by his plans for a new construction atop the destroyed Libra branch, which he plans to finance through calamities he can summon. This will make some pretty good additional income, he muses, revealing a more sinister side to his character.As the chapter concludes, there is a palpable shift towards an all-out war. “Gather everyone under us. We can’t possibly do nothing,” commands a character, setting the stage for impending conflict as forces align against Lee Geon, revealing a brewing storm on the horizon.Overall, this chapter serves to heighten the stakes, with Cheon's paralysis of emotion serving as a foreshadowing of the tumultuous battle between the opposing sides."

The tension kicks off with a demand for a damaged royal divine artifact and culminates in a lively discussion about an urgent delivery from the Divinea, hinting at housewarming gifts which include food, money, and divine artifacts. There's a sense of camaraderie as one character hopes for a positive outcome between two personalities, indicating personal stakes involved.As the scene shifts to the Leo Divine Cadre headquarters, confusion reigns after Yooha abruptly announces her departure, causing unrest among her colleagues who are keen to follow her. One character expresses disbelief at the potential ramifications of her departure, highlighting the emotional weight of such a decision.Meanwhile, Lee Geon sets the stage in Hawaii, stirring curiosity among his friends about his sudden request for their presence and his newly constructed workshop, showcasing his ambitious nature. A former household god, Iaso, also enters the picture, revealing the involuntary circumstances of her arrival and her link to Lee Geon, which entangles them further in the plot.Lee Geon demonstrates his growth and newfound abilities with his Gluttony skill, capable of devouring and recreating objects. As the characters admire his workshop, they discover it is a hub of activity where Lee Geon is crafting weapons, demonstrating his readiness and motivation for the impending conflict as he prepares gifts for his allies, connecting all the threads of their journeys toward a looming war."

What the hell did you do to Yooha?! he demands, expressing his anger at her transformation and his disappointment in himself as a father. Libra dismisses him, offering a twisted solution: Your only solution to save her here would be to let her join my divine cadre. She asserts that Yooha's resilience is impressive, but warns that the evil god's energy will eventually consume her.As Hugo rejects Libra's manipulative tactics, she proposes an enticing deal: if he joins her instead of trying to save Yooha, he'll regain his lost power. Isn’t that a really attractive proposal? Libra taunts, but Hugo sees through her scheme. Libra responds with cold calculation, threatening to take Yooha for herself and expressing her twisted affection towards the children she finds obedient.Meanwhile, another character arrives with an altogether different tone, showing concern for Hugo’s children and reminiscing about raising them. “It’s so hard to raise children... It would be so nice if my children were half as mature as you are,” they remark, contrasting their challenges with the calmness exhibited by Yooha.The chapter culminates in chaos as an explosion rocks the hospital, throwing the events into disarray and leaving the future uncertain for all involved. Was it due to leaked gas? Report this right away! signals the onset of a new crisis, leaving readers on the edge as the stakes rise dramatically."

Sagittarius is furious, demanding that they acknowledge Lee Geon’s legacy and responsibilities. Leo admits his own stagnation and the need to train differently to honor Lee Geon's memory, while grappling with feelings of guilt about the past.The scene escalates when Sagittarius expresses anger over Leo's actions, especially towards Cheon Yooha, who is now aligned with Lee Geon, prompting fear of losing powerful allies. Oliver intervenes, suggesting a forceful approach to recruitment and warning of the dangers involved, leading to chaos as threats are exchanged. Steven Marker expresses his intent to step in, mentioning the use of an evil god against them and the potential consequences for Cheon Yooha, who is under threat from this dark energy.Amidst the turmoil, Steven tries to negotiate while highlighting the power dynamics at play, seeking Sagittarius’s cooperation to surpass Lee Geon. However, Sagittarius is resolute about protecting his daughter and refuses to align with Steven. As the conflict escalates, the risks become clearer, particularly the danger posed by the evil god possessing Yooha, which prompts a plea from Sagittarius for action to prevent further harm.The chapter ends on a cliffhanger with uncertainty about the future of the characters, their alliances, and the looming threat of the evil god, leaving readers eager for the resolution of these chaotic events."

A character exclaims, IT'S BEING SO FLASHY, showcasing their excitement over newfound energy and self-confidence. They prepare to give Yooha a weapon and assign her a mission, reflecting on the thrill of their current position and strength.Another character, possibly Steven Marker, expresses concern, questioning the substance behind the bragging. They criticize another for only being able to inflict sneak attacks, reminding them that they’re not true strength. As accusations fly, a character admits to feeling overwhelmed by the strength of their opponents while lamenting their own inability to catch up.Frustration surfaces when one character asserts that if the Celestial Lord had managed the Divine Cadre better, conflict wouldn’t have escalated. They are determined not to suffer defeats any longer and wish to become stronger, vowing to fight alongside Uncle Lee.Further conflict emerges as one character confronts Steven Marker about choices that disregard the essence of strength, emphasizing that their loyalty to Leo and achievements are being overlooked. In a shocking revelation, they imply that the previous Vice Celestial Lord's demise was due to the actions of the others, leading to heightened tension.As the chapter progresses, Yooha is underestimated, with another character belittling her abilities in combat, claiming her special skill is weak. The chapter sets the stage for an impending clash, with one character daring Yooha to unleash her true power to avoid defeat, creating an atmosphere of inevitable confrontation."

Characters express their disbelief over Sagittarius' subordinates struggling against a weak opponent. Mr. Ivan's insults towards their Celestial Lord spark frustration, prompting a fierce response about securing their sanctuary and addressing the looming threats. We're preparing for departure immediately, one declares. A conversation about the emerging calamities reveals the emergence of the Crimson Eye, previously thought defeated. Didn't Lee Geon kill it in the Demon Tower? someone questions, highlighting confusion about its reappearance and potential threat from Libra, who seems to be mobilizing for an attack.The importance of bolstering security is emphasized with Lee Geon requesting enhancements to the sanctuary. The only one I can count on for this, he insists while hinting at a deeper connection with his ally. However, there’s skepticism about this bond amidst the chaotic situations.They realize they must confront the Crimson Eye and the rising dangers in Korea, setting the stage for confrontation. You’ll have to take care of this... if Libra pulls anything, one warns, detecting possible treachery as they brace for the battle ahead while civilians remain vulnerable amidst the chaos. Amidst the chaos, alliances are tested, and the urgency to defeat their enemies mounts."

One character remarks on the presence of rats and reveals their identity as Ophuchus, the one Libra mentioned. There's a sense of mockery directed towards the underlings of Libra, who appear to be underestimated by another character. One interlocutor points out the surprise defeat of elite knights by a young warrior, indicating his strength and importance, while another comments on some ongoing preparations involving a “Scorpio Divine Artifact” and the need for jurisdiction over the area. The urgency grows among the group as they fear being overwhelmed by an enemy with powers that exceed their defenses. The dialogue highlights concern for a princess's safety and hints at a hidden threat posed by a powerful foe, possibly the main army of an unknown civilization. Amidst the chaos, there's frustration over the destruction of a protective artifact, lamenting the loss and implying serious consequences for their efforts against this emerging threat. The chapter ends with uncertainty, as they grapple with the implications of the powerful enemy's approach."

Another responds, “Knight captain, it’s all over now. The spirit knights have all been defeated!” A captain distraught by the loss laments, “I can’t believe my knights have been defeated this easily!” To which another retorts, “What the hell are you on about?

Yooha expresses frustration about their circumstances, while others quickly assess their predicament. There’s a looming threat from a powerful foe, the Crimson Eye, which is too strong, prompting some characters to reconsider their involvement. They realize they must protect the citizens instead of engaging in a direct fight. Despite the danger, they remain determined to help. One character emphasizes the importance of protecting the weak and fulfilling their duties as strong individuals. There’s a tense discussion about the past and future battles, with references to Lee Geon, who previously defeated the Crimson Eye alone but is now seen as a potential threat.Amid these conflicts, a critical plan is discussed: summoning a Divine God to help in their struggle.

The dialogue highlights a confrontation between two powerful figures, where one questions the other’s courage and effectiveness in handling the Crimson Eye. Why did you attack? one character demands, accusing the other of misplacing their efforts against subordinates instead of the real threat.As they discuss the nature of power, one character taunts, Even if you have your powers now, you’re still just an incomplete saint without your royal divine artifact. The tension continues as they reference past failures and the present situation in America, implying that the Crimson Eye's revival may not be fully stable or complete.Additionally, there's a subplot regarding a recently confirmed report that Hugo Otters has arrived in Korea, setting the stage for a significant confrontation. The chapter wraps with the revelation of impending action that could tip the balance in the ongoing conflicts, as one character declares, We’re joining the war, solidifying the stakes at play and the readiness to confront the challenges ahead.Key points of intrigue include the imminent clash involving the incomplete Crimson Eye, the mysterious Baron Helmet, and uncertainty surrounding Kalli's loyalty. The dialogue encapsulates the themes of power, control, and the dire consequences of the past's actions."

Sagittarius exclaims, What the hell is this? An ice mountain? before realizing he narrowly escaped danger thanks to Cancer. Kevin appears ambivalent, casually asking, That's all you have to say after I saved you? Sagittarius chastises Kevin for his continued defeats in battle and warns him, You need to pay some attention to your sanctuary’s defenses. Kevin shoots back that he didn't come here on purpose, leading to jokes about their navigation skills.They regroup quickly, acknowledging the real threat: the formidable Sagittarius and Virgo. Discussions about their culinary preferences surface humorously, with one character admitting, I like the taste of fire in my food, and another declaring, We won't show any mercy.As tensions boil, the characters prepare for battle against a dangerous entity known as the Crimson Eye, revealing its nature as a vessel for a Black Dragon and its connection to calamities that have haunted them. One character shares his experience, I fought those calamities that revived repeatedly for years! suggesting their deep connection to the realm they're battling.While strategizing, they face a grave issue when a key weapon, a royal divine artifact, breaks unexpectedly. The scene is filled with a mix of humor and seriousness as they plan how to tackle the giant menace ahead and deal with the imminent threats posed by the Crimson Eye and the Black Dragon. As they rally together, the true battle begins."

Seriously, you get beaten up whenever I'm not looking! Despite the seriousness of the situation, there’s a moment of bickering: Hey! Do you think we're up here because we like it?One character, after fruitless attempts to contact another, confronts them about their broken bow and the suspicious accumulation of ancient weapons nearby. The accused nonchalantly states, It just happened to be that way, to which they are met with anger over nearly dying due to their negligence.As the chaos unfolds, a black dragon is revealed, stirring disbelief and panic. Confusion reigns as they learn it’s the other Crimson Eye mentioned in an earlier chapter - Why did you bring that here? However, the character who summoned it, attributing it to useful materials, proudly states, I brought him back to life and tamed him!Yet, the sense of doom persists as they realize that their home is in ruins again, with accusations flying about whose fault it all is. Libra enters the fray, pressuring her subordinates over their failures: You dare say this isn't a failure? She chastises them for their inability to handle necessary missions, declaring, I want the both of you to reflect on yourselves.As the chapter closes, the menacing presence of Libra looms, leaving everyone anxious about what they need to face next: What on earth is going on over there?! The atmosphere is thick with tension as they prepare to confront the calamities ahead."

The dialogue reveals a brewing confrontation filled with anger and vengeance against those responsible for the evil deeds.  Lee Geon expresses the weight of those impacted, stating, “There are countless people that are angry because of you!” Meanwhile, a sense of rising divine power is emphasized as multiple figures, including the Scorpio Divine Cadre, prepare to attack. An exchange between enemies escalates, with one character lamenting, “I can’t believe my clones are all destroyed... I must first destroy your Zodiac stigmas before I can mess you up real good.” The stakes rise as alliances are forged; Hayley, the Scorpio representative, lends her power, “Heavenly Punishment Poison Chain Sword Form,” while Virgo's blessing further escalates Ophiuchus's abilities. As various divine powers clash, Lee Geon critiques the so-called “fury of only seven divine gods,” implying deeper forces may be at play. The chapter culminates in a challenging confrontation filled with accusations and revelations about betrayals and hidden motives, prompting a pivotal moment where the true culprits are questioned, with one character ominously asking, “Do you think there’s anything more fearsome than the true fury of the divine gods?” The promise of a serious showdown looms, leaving the fate of the city and the saints hanging in the balance."

Lee Geon, seemingly at a low point, confronts the consequences of his calamity skill, which forces him to relive painful memories. A mysterious figure, the Vanguard General of the Great Unknown Civilization, emerges to challenge Lee Geon, revealing that his power as a Divine God is dwindling.“This isn’t over; I won’t let you take my body!” Lee Geon protests, demonstrating his fierce resolve even in adversity. The Vanguard General recognizes Lee's strength but underestimates his resolve, remarking, “You’ve defeated Libra and the Phantom Knights! You are no ordinary brat.” This commentary highlights Lee's prowess, acknowledging his past victories and the threat he poses to their plans.As battles rage on, it's revealed that a transformation in Lee's body is due to Super Regeneration, indicating a new phase of his powers but with the caveat of reduced physical abilities. “There is a small penalty,” the Vanguard General ominously notes, suggesting that great power comes with a major price.The chapter intensifies as the discussions of rebuilding the Demon Tower unfold, showing the stakes at play. Lee Geon reflects on the unseen force behind his adversary, contemplating past encounters with weapons imbued with the dangerous power of the Unknown Civilization’s Monarch. “This energy… it’s the same as the dagger that stabbed me!” he realizes, igniting a sense of urgency for the impending clash.With high tensions and revelations about the capabilities of his enemies, the chapter concludes on a cliffhanger, driving the narrative forward as Lee prepares to confront these formidable forces, pushing him deeper into the conflict with his survival and legacy on the line."

One character expresses determination, stating, “I think I can get out of this! Just spill everything?” revealing their desire for information. Another, caught in a dire situation, anxiously notes, “I’ll devour your Saint's power!” as they grapple with their predicament. The dialogue exchanges indicate a sense of urgency, particularly as one character, Baron Helmet, faces disintegration: “The power sustaining Baron Helmet’s body is disappearing!” Amidst the turmoil, another character, Lee Geon, is urged to take action, with the stakes rising dangerously high. There’s tension over loyalty and sacrifice as someone expresses gratitude for what seems like a selfless act, leading to a revelation, “I wanted to meet the Monarch; that’s why I sent you.”Conflict is brewing as they confront the reality of their situation, especially when one laments the idea of being used as bait. The chapter captures a mix of desperation and resolve, culminating in a moment of existential dread as one character shouts, “I’m in deep shit! Who the hell are you?”—a clear sign that the stakes are higher than they ever expected.As they navigate this complex web of alliances and threats, the question looms: “What on earth is going on?” The chapter ends on a cliffhanger, with identities and true powers still shrouded in mystery, leaving readers eager for what’s to come."
