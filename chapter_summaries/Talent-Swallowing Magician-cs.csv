The powers of the empire are divided into four forces, he recalls, underscoring the strength of various factions that dominate their continent. Despite his family's historical significance, having led the war against demons, they have suffered devastating losses, leaving only him and his older sister.The protagonist laments, The disgrace of the Melvingers! How low is the prestigious magic family going to fall? expressing his frustration and anguish over the family's current state. Plagued by a blockage disease that renders him unable to use magic, he feels like a joke to those around him, a magician who cannot even make a circle.As he desperately tries to break free from his curse, he reflects on his dreams of restoring his family’s honor. I worked to death to try to treat the blockage disease, he admits, showcasing his determination despite his misfortune. In a twist of fate, he encounters a dragon, which presents a glimmer of hope. Become one with me and let us take over the world, human, it demands, but he resists, realizing too late that “it was the test of the Demon King.” With urgency and defiance, he vows, I will not be devoured like this! signifying a pivotal moment where he must confront the overwhelming forces that threaten to consume him. The chapter ends with a thrilling sense of determination as he prepares to fight against his seemingly insurmountable challenges."

Despite the prognosis, the character tries to reassure his worried sister, **I’ll be cured from my disease soon!** as she anxiously asks, **What did the doctors say? Did they find a cure?**While grappling with his condition, he reflects on his academic failures, stating, **This marks my third time failing,** indicating the pressure of maintaining his family's pride as a descendant of a prestigious lineage. He laments, **A mere profession like that can’t bring back glory to my family.** The reality of his academic struggle is compounded when he receives insults from peers regarding his grades and the burden of expectations, **How can he be so consistent at your grades?**A friend from a prominent family, Sean Nester, tries to offer help but also reveals a potential opportunity, **You should join the expedition crew too,** referring to a recent discovery of an ancient dragon's nest, which could hold valuable resources. The protagonist struggles with the situation, **Even if I find something like that, it would be collected by the dean anyway.**Ultimately, this chapter highlights the tension between ambition and adversity, as well as the protagonist's internal conflict over his future, expressed when he finally contemplates, **This is the heavens giving me a chance.**"

One character expresses skepticism about their findings, provoking another who believes they have undeniable evidence. Watch your mouth... do you know how many professors took part in this? a professor warns, hinting at the gravity of their research. However, another character argues, The mana does not gather there, therefore, a dragon cannot live there. This back and forth reveals tensions surrounding the research.Despite doubts, one character insists, There is definitely a nest... right here, in the Karagul Cave. As tensions escalate, another exclaims, What you’re saying is that... my research report is wrong? revealing their frustration and the high stakes involved.In a dramatic twist, one character proposes a bet: I will give you all the resources you need to form an exploration, but if you fail... bet the heirloom the first headmaster left behind. This proposition adds pressure, setting the stage for future confrontations and challenges as they seek the elusive dragon's nest."

His friend expresses concern that if they fail to find the nest, Elric's heirloom will be lost. Despite the pressure, Elric remains confident, insisting he accepted the bet not out of fear but out of ambition. Their conversation highlights Elric's troubled past at the academy, where he faced ridicule and was suspended for standing up against an upperclassman. However, he emerged stronger and more determined. The chapter escalates when Elric is confronted with a forbidden book that holds secrets to the Body Strengthening Arts of the Beast King. As an unexpected ally, River, a senior researcher, arrives to offer support at the request of the dean. River brings powerful magical equipment, which raises eyebrows among the peers, given its destructive potential.

An enigmatic scholar laments, We were nothing more than a group of scholars chasing the pinnacle of magic, acknowledging how their ambition led to their corruption by demons and chaos.One character deflects emotions with a sharp, THE FUCK, YOU THINK I'D CRY? revealing vulnerability despite their bravado. They discuss the mysterious transformations that have occurred, grappling with, WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NEST? while the topic of excavation rights and family claims over a dragon's nest becomes contentious: It's normal for strong schools to acquire stakes... The Magic Tower and the Academy are both going wild.The dialogue escalates as one character, clearly distressed, exclaims, YOU DARED TO TRY AND KILL ME? which highlights the dangers surrounding them, while another tactfully asks for a favor, humorously saying, CAN'T HEAR YOU, CAN'T HEAR YOU. The chapter culminates as they navigate the politics tied to their family's legacy and the unscrupulous methods employed to gain power: The NERESTER FAMILY BLOCKING OFF THE HOSPITAL?Despite the chaos, an intriguing introduction of a figure known as THE GREAT DEMON KING suggests the stakes are high, leaving the reader in suspense about the unfolding drama and the characters’ fates in this world filled with magic and ambition."

However, they also sense the urgency of mastering it, fearing that others might seek to overpower them before they fully develop their skills.Struggling with the weight of this newly learned magic, the protagonist longs for a mentor. They lament, “In the academy dominated by barracks, there is no one skilled enough to teach me,” craving guidance from someone of significant stature, perhaps akin to a Castellan.As the tension rises, the character considers Mephisto as a potential teacher. However, a power struggle unfolds, with Mephisto preying on their desperation, “You need to make me strong enough to do that!” reflecting the manipulation at play. The protagonist grapples with their weakness and the implications of becoming a vessel for dark magic.Ultimately, they face a moral dilemma, as Mephisto suggests they submit to this dark path: “Get on your knees and beg me to accept you as my disciple!” The protagonist's defiance, “There’s no way you can make me submit,” underscores their determination, setting up an intriguing conflict for the next chapter as they navigate the treacherous waters of power, ambition, and mentorship."

He recounts their troubled past of being linked to demons, and hints at a grave of a past Yeti king that may hold secrets. The protagonist reflects on the possibility of learning more about their family's legacy linked to the Yeti Highlands, with a childhood story hinting at a significant magic pendant.As tensions rise and they begin to prepare for the trek, they are interrupted by distractions and exchanges, including flirtation, which leads to a confrontation that establishes a protective camaraderie among the travelers.

Another comments on the large number of yetis, recalling, “This reminds me of the nest. Why are there so many of them?” The fear is palpable as another exclaims, “It’s the moronic Crimson Eyes’ tribe! I heard that yetis usually travel in packs, but this is way too many!”Despite the overwhelming odds, there's a mixture of determination and fear as one character quips, “You’re getting scared when it’s actually time to fight, right? That’s typical of a human!” They remark on the impressive display from the knights, wishing for more time to observe their power while acknowledging the pressing danger: “The yetis that launched the surprise attack are a problem, but that’s not the end of them.”With awareness of the looming ambush from another pack of yetis, the characters strategize. One declares, “I’ll at least slow them down!” as they prepare to unleash a spell to gain the upper hand, demonstrating a mix of caution and tactical bravery. The chapter ends with a sense of urgency and anticipation, as the characters are poised to face the imminent threat head-on."

The protagonist reluctantly agrees to act as an interpreter for the antagonistic figure who threatens harm unless they reveal the location of their village. There’s a push for dialogue instead of violence, with tension rising as they discuss releasing captives. One character, concerned about their safety, reflects on a looming threat: to harness the full power of the mystical Dragon-Heart could be catastrophic, risking a fatal explosion if overexerted.Amidst the chaos, there’s a personal stake in the matter; earlier losses weigh heavily on the protagonist, who hopes that a missing ally has escaped danger. If peaceful negotiations collapse, drastic actions may be necessary.The chapter hints at a rich backstory involving legacies and an ancient king of the snowy mountains, who once befriended a human named Melvinger. As more secrets unfold, the protagonist discovers an unexpected link to a hidden house beneath a cliff, stirring excitement and anticipation.In summary, the chapter not only intensifies the conflict but also delves into the lore of the snowy tribe, setting the stage for future confrontations while maintaining a focus on survival and the hope of avoiding bloodshed."

With my current skills, it’s reckless, he admits, but he understands the need to push forward. Discovering a locked door with ancient magic piques his curiosity about the wooden shack and its hidden secrets.As he explores his family's history, he uncovers a book titled Historia ex Merbinger that reveals their duty to combat demons. Eradicating demons is our family's only duty! he recalls, linking it to a dream he had. His ancestor, Otto Han Merbinger, appears as a spirit, explaining that the first test involves swallowing demons to forge a new type of magic.Eat, swallow, and drink, Otto instructs, emphasizing that the act of digesting the demons will usher in a new era of magic. Otto is also tied to the reputation of the Winter Sage and shares a connection to the demon king, Mephistopheles, whom the protagonist has already encountered.As the spiritual guide outlines the difficult assignment before him, he reflects on the necessity of rigorous testing for the descendants. The choice is now entirely up to you, Otto asserts, leaving the protagonist with a pivotal decision as the chapter concludes. The tone is filled with the tension of responsibility and the allure of magical potential, as the protagonist stands at the threshold of his family's legacy."

As her companions express their disbelief in her abilities, one laments, “The sole daughter of the Blue Lion can’t even swing a sword properly.” Yet the miss is determined, reflecting on her family's legacy and their expectations. Despite her struggles, she hears about a legendary king's grave in the Ice Mountain Highlands, possibly rich with treasures and magical tools that could help save her father.However, the threat from her uncle Paul Vile looms large as he dispatches elite assassins to eliminate her. “The young miss must be nearby,” one assassin taunts, leading to a desperate attempt to protect her loyal knights, especially Chen, who sacrifices himself for her sake. “Please run away and don’t look back!” However, the miss feels immense guilt: “Because of me... innocent people died for someone like me?”Amidst the chaos, a glimmer of hope appears as another character named Elric enters the scene, hinting at a potential savior in these dire times. The chapter ends on a tense cliffhanger, setting the stage for the unfolding conflict."

They're staring at you so uneasily, one character remarks, hinting at the unease in the air. Another suggests, It's too early to let our guard down, reflecting suspicion despite gratitude. One individual, grateful yet hesitant, acknowledges their rescuer, saying, I thank our savior! while another dismisses the praise, insisting, I did what anyone would've done. The conversation then shifts to a request for a favor, as one character tentatively asks for an escort to the imperial capital, stating, I don't want to lose even you guys because of my own greed.Amid discussions about past betrayals within the Weyl family and personal insecurities, a character addresses their lineage, revealing, It’s an honor to meet the only daughter of the blue lion. However, this is met with an unexpected response of disbelief, Why would it be an honor to meet someone like me?The chapter builds on the theme of internal struggles and ambition, as plans are set in motion to negotiate with powerful figures, and the threat of stronger enemies looms. If uncle sends even stronger blue wolves, worry shifts to the group's ability to defend themselves, noting their squad had already faced annihilation. Amidst it all, one character reflects on the precariousness of their situation, warning that you only have one chance, setting the stage for high stakes moving forward."

A floating ghost character, mysterious in nature, expresses skepticism about the need to mobilize their powerful Blue Wolf Squad for what seems like a trivial concern regarding the young lady’s return to the imperial capital, which is viewed as a potential surrender.The ghost advises caution, explaining the considerable power of the local lord and the need to keep a low profile. They decide to use illusion magic to disguise themselves rather than engage in direct confrontation. This decision rattles the young miss’s companion, who wonders why they didn’t just eliminate their enemies directly, only to learn that conserving mana is essential.As they enter the city, they contemplate their true situation and the potential dangers they face, especially in a place under tight control. There are discussions about the potential threats from knights who seem to possess a form of mana, with insights about martial artists and mages adapting to harness mana differently.The narrative then shifts as they engage in some political maneuvering regarding excavation rights that could grant them an advantage in an upcoming election, hinting at the complex dynamics of power within their society. The gravity of these political issues weighs heavily on the young master, who is determined to secure his position despite making enemies in the process.Finally, there's an underlying sentiment of nostalgia and concern for a character named Sean, who finds himself in troubled waters due to the young master's ambitions. The chapter closes on a note of uncertainty and anticipation, leaving readers curious about the unfolding political and magical challenges they must navigate."

Amidst this uncertainty, the protagonist contemplates the significance of trust and righteousness in leadership.Meanwhile, humor is interjected by Simonan's flippant remarks about their situation, despite the dire circumstances that await them. With warnings about unaccounted enemies and potential mages amongst them, the stakes are as high as ever. The protagonist is filled with frustration and rage, grappling with their perceived powerlessness to protect innocent lives against the encroaching threat of the Merbingers.Determined to uphold the family's honor, the protagonist vows to confront these dangers head-on, despite the risks involved. The internal struggle of wanting to fight yet feeling inadequate is highlighted as the characters prepare for the upcoming conflict with formidable foes. The chapter closes with an awareness of the heavy burden that comes with power, driving the protagonist to seek a way to stand strong alongside their allies."

As chaos ensues, a group of Paul’s subordinates, fearing the retaliation of the Magic Tower, plots to kill Isabel and retreat.

The reminder that reality is harsher than the games he’s played hits hard as he faces the oncoming battle, mocked by his opponents who urge him to display his strength. Tension builds as a flare signal hints at impending danger, leading to a frantic order: Kill him before he activates it!

Set fire, and if that’s not enough, set yourselves on fire and run.”As the battle unfolds, the tactics of the Blue Wolves come into play, utilizing joint attacks against their enemies. One strategist mentions, “They perform joint attacks to kill the enemy, even when facing just one,” highlighting their teamwork. However, a plan to lure and trap the enemies backfires, leading to fears of a devastating magic circle prepared by the enemy, warning, “It’d be impossible without thorough calculations and confidence.”Amidst the conflict, one character contemplates the challenges they face due to restrictions on their magic abilities, realizing a curse is weakening them: “Is it because of the Seal of Cruelty? All magic that isn’t of the ice attribute got weaker.” However, they acknowledge that “there is a way,” showing glimpses of hope despite overwhelming odds.The ensuing battles are tense, with one member crying out, “Blocking them instead of evading was your blunder,” as they confront the dangerous ice magic and its curses. In a shocking moment, the reality of their situation sinks in: “The 1st Squad captain made a blunder… He shouldn't have sent just us.” With stakes high and strategies faltering, the chapter closes, leaving readers anxious for the next confrontation."

Can’t just run away with our tails between our legs, can we?” urges one of the Blue Wolves, emphasizing the desperation of their situation. As the battle escalates, another character cynically notes, “The only race crazier than demons are humans! This is the true face of your race!” highlighting the darker aspects of humanity amidst the turmoil. A sense of hopelessness looms when one acknowledges the ominous magic scroll, revealing, “One mistake and the whole city might become a sea of fire.”Amidst the conflict, another character is injured but maintains a fierce resolve, sarcastically pointing out, “You were ugly from the start, but now you're a complete mess.” The tension builds as they realize they have overlooked the remaining Blue Wolves, leading to a defensive stance, “Didn’t you tell me to use the magic that I was so proud of?” In a moment of vulnerability, a young miss reveals her past with the knights, expressing her longing for acceptance, “The knights always kept their distance from a talentless person like me.” However, she resolves to change this and seeks power, acknowledging, “I also have to change my weak attitude.”Expressing a desire to rally support, she declares, “I will go to Carney where my father is recuperating to plan for the future.” Yet, despite her determination, there remains an undercurrent of uncertainty, as she worries about her father's health and the looming challenges ahead, knowing, “A lion cannot mingle with mages.”Finally, a glimmer of hope emerges when someone provides a possible cure for the ailment afflicting the Blue Lion, suggesting, “It’s the cure for the blockage disease.” This sparks a chance for salvation, setting the stage for potential change and future battles as alliances are sought and risks are taken."

After he reveals his identity to Isabel and provides her with treatment for a disease, they decide to part ways. Elric heads to the imperial capital with intentions of humiliating Barracks, but he faces skepticism and unwelcoming reception instead.Characters in the capital gossip about the heroic mage, Elric, and his recent achievements, including his rumored involvement with Isabel, the Blue Lion's daughter. Amidst the buzz, Lazuli suggests that Elric could benefit from being portrayed as a hero, which would bolster his reputation and help with his plans against Paul Weyland. Elric contemplates this idea while reflecting on his family's revival and the chaos unfolding due to delegation issues surrounding excavation rights.Meanwhile, Elric's friend Sean checks in on his rather complicated life and the heavy rumors swirling about them. As they converse over drinks, it's clear that Sean is both teasing and concerned about the changes occurring in Elric's life since his return. However, worry strikes when Elric learns that the excavation rights have been misleadingly claimed by the Academy, raising the stakes further for him and his ambitions.The chapter ends with Elric feeling the pressure as he must navigate the shifting dynamics of power and protect his family's legacy amidst growing threats."

Elric confronts the deceit surrounding the excavation rights that belong neither to his family nor the academy, exclaiming his frustration about being deceived. Barracks, a leading candidate, confidently delivers a speech about his vision for making groundbreaking discoveries like the Gem Dragon Nest, already acting as if he has secured victory. However, there's doubt among the observers about whether he can achieve his promises alone.The atmosphere becomes charged when Elric reveals that despite Barracks’ overwhelming approval rating, his supporters have been bribed, complicating the election outcome. As the votes begin to be cast using magic crystals, an unexpected disturbance occurs when the presumed comatose Lord of the Merbinger family makes an appearance. Elric claims his rightful position as an election representative and challenges Barracks' qualifications, accusing him of severe misconduct. This triggers the possibility of a re-vote, shaking the very grounds of the election and hinting at deep-seated corruption within the academy's ranks. The chapter closes with the stakes heightened, as alliances are questioned and the legitimacy of the candidates hangs in the balance."

Elric confronts Barracks, claiming, You are suspected of forging documents and instigating the murder of the Radiant Star Duke! Barracks defiantly responds, Can you prove that I'm... a criminal? The atmosphere becomes charged as Elric argues for the other election members to consider Barracks's ineligibility due to these allegations.“You're saying there's actually a dragon's nest?” Barracks scoffs, but Elric persists that Dean Barracks tried to eliminate him and take his family's heirloom. The accusations fly back and forth, escalating a power struggle, “He's framing me!” Barracks protests in desperation.Unexpectedly, Rivern, an ally of Barracks, is revealed to have been caught loitering suspiciously. “Rivern must have been ordered by Barracks to do something again,” Elric muses, inferring deeper corruption.Elric capitalizes on this evidence, stating, By law, possession of dungeons goes to the discoverer. Barracks took excavation rights without my permission! The chapter concludes with Elric firmly shifting the tide of the election, pushing for Barracks’s deprivation of candidacy due to his sins, while exuding growing confidence, “Thank you for placing me in the honorable position of USDON Academy’s headmaster.”Suddenly, the stakes are raised again, as Barracks grapples with betrayal and humiliation, his disbelief evident: “I was made a fool out of by a bastard like that?” It’s clear that the political machinations have only begun, setting the stage for an intense showdown in the next chapter."

A central figure instructs a subordinate to ensure that a man named Merbinger does not meet with Hilton and his brother, threatening to kill him if he leaves the Nereester family home.Amidst these threats, one character reflects on the complex magical environment surrounding them, noting that the Nereester family's wind attributes can manipulate various magical elements, even potentially creating a typhoon. This character resolves to enhance their own magic by adapting techniques observed in the Nereester family’s unique mana flow.Another character expresses frustration regarding their allies, feeling neglected after a near-fatal experience, and reflects on the impressive magical abilities that have surpassed their own. They meet Elric Merbinger, the lord of the Merbinger family, who apologizes for earlier disturbances, and hints at a deeper connection and understanding between their families.As the chapter unfolds, the urgency grows for one character to seek out a talented young mage who could be the key to battling the growing corruption in their world. However, they must grapple with the consequences of an ominous curse linked to the Blue Wolves, raising the stakes for the impending confrontation with increasing uncertainty and danger. Meanwhile, mention is made of the Blue Hawks and their connections to Elric, suggesting that alliances will soon play a crucial role in the upcoming conflict."

The senator demands respect, stating, THIS IS THE LORD'S OFFICE! to which Elric responds with composure, acknowledging the senator's status. Augustine Nereester, the great master of mages, discusses his desire to take Elric as his disciple, surprising those present, as it’s uncommon for someone of Elric's status, the DUKE OF MERBINGER, to accept such an offer. Elric skillfully navigates the discussion, hinting at his cleverness: “ISN'T THAT SIDE OF ME THE REASON WHY YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE ME AS YOUR DISCIPLE?” Although flattered, he hesitates, claiming it’s undeserved due to the burdens he faces. He recalls the suffering caused by the senator, revealing an underlying tension.As the chapter climaxes, chaos ensues when a friend's kidnapping is mentioned, highlighting Elric’s peculiar nature and the rising stakes: “YOU CONTINUE TO MAKE ME SPEECHLESS.” The great master, in a moment of vulnerability, reflects on almost losing Elric, revealing the manipulative games they play for power and knowledge. The chapter ends on a suspenseful note as Elric struggles with the disruption of his mana, suggesting deeper mysteries at play: “MY MANA...

The old man hints at the significance of mastering magic martial arts, which is key to helping Elric harness the mana locked within him. Elric learns about Magic Martial Arts and the unique academy called Grassland that specializes in combining different forms of magic. This information reignites hope in Elric: “I THINK I CAN FREELY RECEIVE EXCELLENT TEACHINGS PERFECT FOR ME,” he considers, recognizing the potential in the situation presented to him.Meanwhile, Paul Weyl’s past grievances are highlighted, as he laments losing the chance to become the Blue Lion due to the interference of the Blue Wolf Squad.

They realize that their current state makes it extremely difficult for them to succeed again. I can only pull in mana from the atmosphere once or twice, they express, feeling desperate for their previous magical abilities.Suddenly, a thought strikes: Physical training? The Strong Body Art! This ancient technique, claimed to give practitioners extraordinary strength and body resilience, must be the key to survival. They delve into the philosophy behind it—how the body is a miniature version of the world, interconnected like the flow of mana in nature, which resonates with their current predicament.As they train, they think, “Just look at the world as it is. Instinct and intuition. A fighting technique made from the boundary between them.” Their journey takes a turn when they discover a magical flower that may help replenish their mana, realizing it could even enhance their abilities. Could this place be connected to demons somehow? they ponder.After ten days filled with training, they finally see a glimmer of hope: Thanks to him, I can increase my seal's achievement level. With newfound determination and strength, they prepare to confront the last of their challenges, ready to face whatever comes next."

The Beast King declares, “If you manage to defeat even this dire wolf, I will make you my disciple!” However, when the young wizard mentions his current loyalty to Lord Augustine, the Beast King argues that having multiple mentors is acceptable. “Having just one master is nothing more than a social norm!”As the young wizard seeks permission to learn the art of controlling beasts, he realizes the stakes: “I’ll have to defeat the dire wolf solely using magic martial arts.” After briefly exploring the implications of demonic energy within the domain of the Night's Chronicle, they delve into the mysterious history of the shrine, which ties back to a vengeful alchemist.“Are you saying the founder's grudge has gone on to this day?” the young wizard asks. The Beast King confirms, “Yes. Almost for a thousand years.” The chapter hints at a connection between the past conflicts involving demon kings and the current journey of mastering powerful magic.As the Beast King reflects on past battles and his own goals in training the wizard, he reveals, “I will settle the winner of the battle that day through a disciple that will come my way one day.” The chapter closes with the anticipation of the wizard's ultimate challenge against the dire wolf, setting the stage for his growth and the unfolding of their shared destinies."

One character expresses frustration over their brother's lack of response and the challenges they face. Another character, a master, encourages them to fight against a seal, identifying their unique ability to absorb demon seals despite being human.The master discloses a personal secret about their own background and powers, underscoring the theme of trust between mentor and student. They reflect on their shared uncertainties and the nature of greed, acknowledging the goals they each have. Amidst this, a character named Elric Merbinger pays respect to Sir Augustine Nereester, further indicating a connection among powerful figures. The dialogue indicates a focused determination to absorb the seal of a formidable entity referred to as the Savage Beast, a demon king recognized even by Mephisto. The talk shifts to the process of acquiring powers, comparing it to learning to eat—emphasizing that absorbing seals is inherent yet complex. However, an unsettling atmosphere prevails as characters note the eerie silence in the swampy surroundings, hinting at a lurking danger in the quiet, filled with anticipation of what may emerge from the darkness. The chapter leaves readers on edge, sensing an approaching predator's presence in a world devoid of life."

The chapter opens with characters arguing about the chaotic events caused by a crazy witch. One character implies the blame lies on another for stirring up trouble. They mention the Radiant Star Duke's elder sister, revealing her sacrifices for her less magically gifted brother. This leads to curiosity about her character, considering she is the person the Duke fears most.A character named Haze Merbinger attempts to enter the Nester House but is blocked due to a lack of invitation and a distrustful reception from guards. They demand to meet Sean, but the guards have orders from the young miss. Haze introduces herself with confidence, complimenting the guards despite being denied entry.To prove her identity, Haze engages in a challenge. The guards propose a magic battle; however, Haze admits she cannot use magic. Instead, they settle on a physical contest. Haze reveals her history of playing catch with Sean, boasting about her undefeated record. The guards realize that Haze's martial skills are impressive since she can handle a heavy sledgehammer without using magic. However, they are shocked to discover that she is a part of a renowned mercenary corps.The chapter ends on a light-hearted note, with Haze's sister showing up and playfully chiding her for her antics, hinting at their familial bond and foreshadowing future interactions. Overall, the chapter combines elements of rivalry, family dynamics, and the strength of character amidst the complexities of their magical world."

Elric reflects on their childhood and acknowledges his sister’s overprotectiveness after losing their parents, revealing, “I LOST CONTACT WITH YOU FOR HALF A YEAR...

They discuss the expectations weighing upon their family, with one character expressing a newfound determination to take on dangerous assignments left by their ancestors, declaring, “I'M GONNA GO TO THE NORTH... NO MATTER WHAT... I WILL WALK IT... JUST LIKE OUR ANCESTORS.”As their conversation unfolds, the dynamics between the characters shift, showcasing their history and the burdens of their lineage, especially when one contemplates alliances with formidable groups like Black Skull, saying, “I GUESS I'LL TAKE THIS CHANCE TO MAKE A FRIEND MY AGE...

Augustine teases him about his past, saying, It feels like yesterday when you were begging us to be your masters! As the group gears up, **Tam Haze** thanks the others for watching over his brother, while **Elric** shows his displeasure at the notion of souvenirs, grumbling, Souvenirs, my ass. Let’s never see each other again.As the mood becomes more nostalgic, **Charlie** reminisces about their adventures, noting, Doesn't this remind you of old times? prompting laughs as they poke fun at each other’s age and vitality. When discussing plans and preparations, Elric’s companions are worried about Paul’s threat, suggesting, Why don't we stop this farce and just go to Paul directly and kill him? However, Elric asserts, The matters of House Weyl are mine to resolve. You three just need to keep Isabel safe.The chapter wraps up with Elric reluctantly preparing for a carriage ride, querying **Karl**, his ‘coachman,’ with a bit of sarcasm, My name is not coachman, but Karl, to which Elric responds with an insistence to leave their travel issues behind and look forward to their northern venture.Thus concludes the season, setting a precedent for future adventures while skillfully balancing character interactions, humor, and the looming challenges they face."

One villager steps forward to take the blame for their bandit actions, pleading for punishment to be directed solely at them. Another villager insists that the circumstances led everyone to make desperate choices out of survival. Elric, a noble, is urged to consider their plight—acknowledging that while they have committed crimes, it is not entirely their fault given the dire conditions they face. He contemplates showing mercy, understanding that it is a noble duty to care for the suffering.Tensions rise when a confrontation occurs with would-be bandits who threaten the villagers. Elric’s teacher, the Beast King, is eager to demonstrate his strength but is stopped by Elric, who argues against unnecessary violence. The situation escalates, highlighting the struggle between might and mercy, as the villagers desperately plead for understanding, asserting that they are simply desperate individuals trying to feed their families.The chapter captures the clash between duty and compassion, as well as the moral dilemmas faced by those in positions of power amidst desperation."

The Ritual Leader expresses frustration about a certain unbeliever thwarting the Great One's plans. They plan to revive the demon Azazel and are concerned about the ignorance of the people regarding ongoing demonic schemes. As the characters discuss the tragedy of innocent lives sacrificed and the impending investigation by the Administration Bureau, the protagonist, Elric, is called to investigate a desolate location where demonic energy is suspected to be buried. Using his powerful ice magic, he uncovers a totem linked to Azazel, indicating a dark purpose for human sacrifices. They realize the villagers may have been targets for this revival.Elric and his companions grapple with the grave implications of renewed demonic activity and the crumbling trust in the hierarchy. Plans are made to alert the Administration Bureau about the evidence found, but there are concerns about the consequences for Elric if he doesn't handle the demonic energy correctly. There's a sense of urgency as they vow to uncover more about the sinister forces lurking in the human realm, setting up a major confrontation against the demonic plot at play."

Elric's bravery draws praise: You did great, Elric. If you hadn't done anything about them, I’d have cracked open their heads. However, he is reminded of the Bureau's persistent nature: Once they bite onto something, they never let go.Despite the challenges, Elric asserts, I'm not the kind of person that’d let things end just like this. The Bureau agents, underestimating him due to their arrogance, are quickly put in their place. One agent sneers, How dare you speak casually...We’re agents of the Imperial Family’s Inspection Bureau. Elric's true power surfaces as he reveals his connection to the Magic Tower's strongest individual, shifting the entire dynamic: You’re from the GREAT INSPECTION BUREAU, how on earth... is he doing this? Elric's status commands respect, catching the agents off-guard: He's at a level that’s close to a Magus?!As tensions rise, the Bureau demands answers about missing demon totems, to which Elric confidently responds, I'm from the Merbinger family. He stands firm against accusations, insisting on his right to possess the totems for research, ultimately deflecting their intimidation tactics: I think I've answered enough. Let’s end this, okay?The chapter highlights a power struggle where Elric's confidence and lineage challenge the Bureau's authority, setting the stage for further confrontations."

Mado warns others to be careful as they discuss the difficulty the Inspection Bureau will have finding their secret location. He mentions using a secret passageway to carry out the sacred relics while expressing his uncertainty about their plan.The Crown Prince confronts his own feelings of shame and responsibility, admitting that his jealousy and recklessness have put everyone in jeopardy. While he reflects on the past, particularly concerning Lady Isabel, his focus shifts to the pressing issue of exterminating demon remnants, specifically targeting Viscount Garot’s allegiance to Grigori.As the Inspection Bureau actively searches for demons, Mado acknowledges the wisdom of sending a familiar to gather intelligence, revealing the Crown Prince’s hidden presence among them. A sense of urgency pervades as characters prepare for a clash between the Inspection Bureau and the demon remnants.Resolute and belligerent, a character hints at dealing violence against their foes while encouraging their allies to infiltrate and secure their escape route. Amidst all this, there’s a mix of determination and impending chaos, with the potential for confrontation looming as the chapter concludes."

Carl expresses concern over their lack of maps or tools for navigation, pondering, But how do you plan on looking for the demihumans in such a large place? As they move deeper into the snowfield, they notice the ice crystal they carry begins to glow, suggesting a path forward. When the crystal stops shining upon entering the forest, the group debates their next move, leading to the decision to return to the horse carriage to wait for further guidance from the crystal. Suddenly, they come across an injured female demihuman, prompting a protective response, You must be in great pain; let me help you.Tensions rise as the demihuman refuses aid, stating, I don’t need any help from a human! Their encounter takes a dangerous turn when they confront an imposing wall, with guards emphasizing the perilous nature of the area beyond: The monsters and unexplainable phenomena are present; we are on emergency standby.After some negotiations, Carl successfully persuades the guards to let them pass, as he has a permit from an esteemed family. However, the guards ominously warn, Only then would it be easier for us to find your corpses if they were to face danger. As they move on, the difficulties of the environment and the nature of the Black Snow Field become evident, described as a poisonous wasteland where even archmages are at risk.Determined to discover the long-mythologized Temple of Flower, the characters must confront the deeply ingrained animosity of the demihumans towards humans, sparking doubts about their safety: The demihumans have a deep-seated grudge against humans. However, the protagonist reassures his companions that he has a plan, hinting at future developments with I have a way of winning them over. The chapter closes with a blend of tension and anticipation for what lies ahead in their journey."

The royal guards are called to action against the vicious human. Tension escalates with Elric and the beastmen clashing, as Elric asserts he'll handle the situation alone with confidence. Amidst the turmoil, a royal guard warns of the danger humans pose, revealing the deep-rooted animosity beastmen have towards them for past grievances.Irina, a royal bodyguard, confronts a group of humans, asserting that their presence in beastmen territory is unwelcome and dangerous. Elric, not intimidated, provocatively engages with the beastmen, referencing the legendary Body Strengthening Art that embodies the authority of the former Tiger King, raising the stakes of the confrontation. Realizing the implications of such power, the beastmen react with fury, denouncing Elric's audacity in discussing an art that symbolizes their past glory. As tensions peak, the king demands order, leaving the chapter on a knife-edge as Elric faces potential execution for his defiance."

One noble expresses their distrust, saying, The humans used sweet nothings to lure us and then cowardly stabbed us in the back. Another argues against making deals with humans, emphasizing, If we accept this deal, we’ll be playing into the hands of the humans once again.Despite the reservations, there is pressure to accept the offer of the body strengthening art to rebuild the royal family and honor the last words of the previous king. If we want to fulfill the last words of the previous king, then we need the body strengthening art, they insist. The finance minister Norus, known for his wisdom, is cautious. He reminds them, He's devoted his life to the kingdom, highlighting his loyalty while questioning whether his judgment has faltered with age.As negotiations unfold, the tension grows, particularly when a human offers the body strengthening art at a steep price. The body strengthening art is a symbol that unites the beastmen, one leader argues, calling for unity against their common enemy, the Fury tribe. They collectively rally around the idea that securing this art could restore their strength and identity, with one declaring, If we can build up the spirit of the Tiger King, they wouldn’t dare to mess with us!However, Norus warns them, If we lose the symbol of the royal family like this... acknowledging the risks involved. Ultimately, the chapter is characterized by internal conflict among the beastmen about trusting a human deal against a backdrop of past suffering, underscoring the complexity of their situation."

He laments, H-how impudent! I might look young, but I’m still the king! showcasing his frustration with the current dilemma. The urgency grows when Irina, the royal bodyguard captain, reveals that the finance minister already knows that you’re here. There’s an increasing sense of danger as the scene unfolds with beastmen gathering outside, and the King realizes, The enemies are coming! Prepare for combat! A battle seems inevitable, and characters express doubt about escaping secretly, with someone noting, With our current members, we can just subdue all of them. However, they acknowledge the powerful forces against them, including the Fury Tribe, who have conflicts with Anthromorph.As the dialogue shifts to political matters, one character reflects on the fickle nature of power, stating, If there isn’t anything to support it, then it would only be looked down upon. This reveals the fragility of their situation as they confront those who once looked down on them when they lost power.Elric tempers the mood, albeit bluntly, saying, Must you speak like that to someone who must be really upset right now? amid all the turmoil. The escalated emotions and the impending conflict only fuel their need for alliances and aid, leading to the mention of the powerful Tiger King Yul and the critical body-strengthening art.In a climactic moment, a character offers, I’ll personally guide you to that place, so please give me the body strengthening art, setting the stage for a daring journey filled with political intrigue and the looming threat of battle. The chapter ends with a mix of hope and tension as alliances are sought in the face of danger, highlighting the precariousness of their situation."

The stakes increase as they realize their king is in danger and demand, OPEN UP A PATH IF YOU WANT TO SAVE your KING!

This sense of vulnerability is echoed in another character’s plea, I’m weak...and I have nothing to offer you.However, the theme of friendship emerges, as one encourages another: Friends don’t care about things. You just need to ask. Ask for help, and your friends will go wherever you need help. A revelation dawns as the protagonist realizes, I can’t possibly look away, committing to assist their endangered friend.The chapter concludes with a clear message of solidarity: Sean, tell this to the rest.

Characters express their determination to stop the beastmen, with one stating, “Just leave this place to us, nephew-in-law,” demonstrating their confidence in tackling the threat. However, panic sets in as they realize the extent of the enemy’s advance, leading to questions like, “What can we do, then?! If you have any good ideas, speak up!” The discussions grow heated, suggesting a divide on whether to fight or surrender. The Finance Minister insists they must fight for their city, rallying support from others who fear for their lives if they do nothing: I don’t want to die like this! Amidst the chaos, a character, perhaps feeling overconfident, declares that the current foe is an “easy defeat,” suggesting a strategy but ultimately realizing the complexity of the situation: Damn it. Now that I'm inside... it'll be hard for me to get out.

The chapter closes on a note of uncertainty regarding the outcome of the impending battle, with a character asserting, “Leave this place to me. You can go on ahead,” indicating a willingness to face danger head-on, while a pivotal clash looms in the distance."

The Premier expresses concern about a plan to sever the soul's link to his heart, a move that could lead to demonic energy being unleashed. I’ll take care of the rest, they say as they prepare to execute this risky plan. The dialogue hints at a deeper evolution of the Premier's condition, highlighting the duality of strength and danger in his pursuit of power. As the characters discuss their past decisions, the Premier reveals, I couldn’t see any hope for Anthromorph any longer, which led him to collaborate with demons, using their strength to save his realm. The Radiant Star Duke becomes suspicious of the Premier's transformation into a demon, realizing that the essence of a demonic tree, which the Premier consumed, is fueling his impending change, I’ll soon become a demon. The Premier struggles with his fate, contemplating sacrifice for the greater good: If I die, then the demon within me will die as well. His determination leads him to ask for a favor, seeking a complicated treatment only his master can provide. This revelation paves the way for tense possibilities as allies rally to support the Premier, understanding the risk at hand. If you screw up, we could all get in big trouble, they warn, highlighting the gravity of the situation. Ultimately, the chapter concludes with a sense of urgency and a potential resolution as the characters prepare to confront the unknown risks of their choices and the fate of Anthromorph hangs in the balance."

The old man expresses a commitment to teaching Elric sincerely, while Elric teases about his win, suggesting it was a mere fluke. As they arrive at the Temple, a confrontation brews between those wanting to claim Elric for martial arts training and those who wish to keep him focused on magic.One character insists on the importance of learning martial arts, arguing that Elric possesses extraordinary talent and could greatly benefit from training. Tensions rise as another figure, protective of Elric, challenges the notion of taking him away, claiming both have valuable skills to offer him. Amidst the conflict, Elric steps in to advocate for himself, expressing a desire to learn martial arts—not to abandon magic, but to strengthen his overall combat abilities as they face powerful demons.The discussions reveal conflicting desires among the adults: one eager to teach martial arts, the other out of concern for retaining their unique roles as mentors. Elric emphasizes the importance of a strong foundation to enhance his strengths, ultimately leading to a consensus that respects his autonomy. The chapter closes with a recognition of the mutual benefits in learning from both approaches, laying the groundwork for Elric's growth as he seeks to become stronger in a time of impending conflict."

One character expresses disbelief over the state of the temple, attributing the damage to a mere winter. There is a sense of urgency as they discuss the need to activate the second arrangement to prevent their family from suffering a similar fate.A newcomer reveals his purpose: to deliver an ice crystal to the God of Camellias, who is currently withering away due to the cold imposed by the Eastern General. However, doubts arise about the God of Camellias' well-being and the historical context of their struggles. The group faces obstacles but is eventually welcomed by Huniatroquaz, the landscaper of the temple, who explains the temple's current status during the hibernation period of the gods and emphasizes the need for proper behavior during their visit. Amid humor and miscommunication, we meet Daffo, the God of Daffodils, who dramatizes her charm and unexpectedly draws complaints from the other characters. The chapter ends on a note of uncertainty as the God of Daffodils seems to hide something, setting the stage for conflict regarding her existence."

If I swallow it, I'll be able to obtain a tremendous amount of power, he thinks, recalling his ultimate goal: I want to put the Eastern General into the Seal of Cruelty. He realizes that the challenges will be greater this time, as his opponent is expected to be stronger than the Snow Mountain King.Confused about the task at hand, he receives a seed which he learned must grow into a tree within a hundred days. It's just growing a tree?! he questions incredulously. Meanwhile, he meets the God of Camellia, who chides him for his appearance, hinting at a grudging familiarity between them. They discuss a promise made by Elric's grandfather, a connection that becomes significant as she remarks on their family's history.Elric finds himself entangled in the implications of this promise and is cautious about taking rash actions: I can’t just get married recklessly since I represent my household. The God of Camellia implies that this journey is interconnected with his ancestors.After a significant revelation about the history of the Black Snowfield, Elric prepares to face his next challenge in the Temple of Flowers. It’s established that this land was once a blessing, now tarnished by the appearance of death. With determination, Elric gears up for a daunting task ahead as he learns about his lineage and the necessity of swallowing the Eastern General to fulfill his destiny."

They ponder the importance of being near water while searching for “Authromorph” and suggest it should be close to the land’s gorges or hills, as those details haven’t changed much over time.“I’ve provided enough guidance,” one character states, indicating they are going to take a break. They remind their companion to focus on completing the mission while they are away. The mention of a monster lurking nearby raises concerns, emphasizing the dangers in their surroundings. “Growing this seed is complicated,” another character remarks, highlighting the challenges of their task amidst the unfamiliar terrain. They encounter a divine figure who humorously responds to marriage proposals but reiterates the difficulty of growing a Camellia tree.Finally, the characters strategize about where to plant a special seed and how to respond to the challenges posed by their environment, culminating in a determination to purify the land to facilitate growth. Overall, the chapter highlights themes of teamwork, strategic planning, and the mystical challenges of their magical quest."

He's amazed that Elric not only knows the Body Strengthening Art but also possesses magical abilities.As Ralph acknowledges the unique situation, he devises a plan to subdue Elric without harming him, prompted by the acknowledgment that Elric is to become family. The conversation transitions into realizing that Elric has surpassed expectation, winning the battle, prompting the tribe to accept him as one of their own.Elric's confidence shines through as he states that regardless of the fight's outcome, he wishes to contribute to the tribe. Acknowledging the deep-rooted divisions among races, he speaks on the need for unity, referencing the teachings of the Tiger King. Amidst rallying support, Ralph struggles with the internal conflict of tradition versus the evolving dynamics within the tribe, leading to a challenge where Elric boldly proposes that if he wins, he becomes part of the tribe, but if he loses, he will leave. This chapter highlights themes of acceptance, unity, and the challenge of societal norms through the struggle of individuals pushing against the boundaries laid by their respective backgrounds."

Characters discuss the beauty of the flowers, drawing comparisons to the Queen, who now feels isolated and empty in her vast palace. As the Queen reflects on her solitude amidst a barren winter landscape, she expresses a desire to escape her loneliness.Amidst these contemplations, an exchange about magic unfolds. One character expresses an admiration for magic and suggests teaching it, sparking a playful dialogue about becoming a chieftain instead of being enslaved by the duty to teach. They share a moment of nostalgia, recognizing the evolution of their tribe since they met the Queen.Suspicion arises when one character realizes the other had ulterior motives in their encounters with hostile tribes. They discuss the importance of mutual interests but ultimately confront a looming threat—the Ice General. The presence of malicious intent from the God of Camellia raises the stakes as they strategize to break free from the suffocating grip of the Ice General's darkness.As they prepare for battle, a plan begins to form to absorb the Ice General’s cold and demonic energy using seals they possess. The urgency intensifies, with the looming danger hinting at a significant confrontation ahead. The chapter culminates in a blend of introspection and imminent action, showcasing both the emotional depth of the Queen's plight and the tactical responses to the incoming threat."

The dialogue begins with a longing for the beautiful flowers of the past, as one character expresses, That’s the sight you wanted to protect even after you were reborn as the God of Camellia. They are determined to restore the lost beauty, as they strategize about how to revert the effects of the Seal of Winter Wind. The plea for assistance is met with a friendly reassurance: Don’t be so formal with me. There’s no need to do that between friends.However, the story takes a darker turn as the warriors struggle against increasing peril, with one noting, The warriors are slowly taking more damage. An ominous figure is revealed, This is definitely the energy of the Ice General that was filled with malice. Despite the dreariness of winter, new flowers manage to bloom symbolizing hope, prompting a character to reflect, It’s so beautiful... although the outside world is still a cold world.Amidst the chaos, they encounter the Ice and Snow Queen, who is burdened with her own contradictory nature—a ruler of winter who must embrace both the beauty and poison of spring. The chapter closes on a somber note, with the realization that while winter reigns, there exists the potential for warmth and life, hinting at a continuing struggle between seasons and the emotional depth of the characters within this stark world."

They acknowledge the complexity of family matters they shouldn’t interfere with and express their resolve not to run from their battles, despite the daunting opponent they face: “That thing is so tough. I don’t know what it’s made of.”They strategize on how to deliver effective attacks, revealing a deeper understanding of fighting techniques, emphasizing that it takes more than instinct: Body strengthening art needs a certain basic framework.

ACESTOP STANDING AROUND! GO BREAK IT! one shouts, revealing a sense of urgency in their quest. They discuss using an ice crystal to absorb cold energy, hoping to awaken the Winter Flowers and harness divine powers. If we gather the powers of the flowers and grow this 'Winter Flower,' we might even be able to place the Ice General in there and call forth 'Spring', another explains, laying out their plan.There’s a connection to the Queen, who holds the power of Spring in the flower garden, they remind each other, emphasizing their need to reclaim the lost seasons. However, some voice concern: We shouldn't move without any information, they argue, highlighting the risks involved.I'm not saying we shouldn't kill her, one character clarifies, but we need a solid plan. Each has differing motivations, and while some express doubts, they ultimately come to a consensus, It looks like everyone's in agreement. Shall we go right away then?As preparations are made, one character reflects on their strength: “I would’ve cut off his head in a single attack, but that’d be tough to do at the moment since my body is still recovering.” A sense of camaraderie forms as they acknowledge shared struggles. There’s also a moment of introspection when one character senses a strange affection when seeing a fellow ally despite his flaws, revealing the complexity of their relationships.Lastly, there's a frantic call for retreat, suggesting that the situation has suddenly turned dire, leaving everyone in suspense about what might happen next. What is it again?! one cries out, hinting at unforeseen challenges ahead."

One character emphasizes the importance of executing the mission without mistakes, while another expresses concern about their current situation, revealing the tension among the group. As they move in secrecy, preparations to combat the Ice General are underway. One character remarks on the failure of a prior plan to burn the temple, indicating a growing frustration that is now turning into anticipation for battle. They strategize on how to destroy barriers protecting the cities within the Fury Tribe, exploiting the absence of the Blood Wolf King’s blessing to provoke fear and chaos.However, questions arise about the motives of the Anthromorphs attacking the barriers, especially considering their fear of the Ice General. A character reveals critical details about their manipulation of the cities through the Ice General’s intimidation, and concerns grow over the potential discovery of this hidden truth.The chapter concludes with the Fury Tribe responding predictably to the provocation, setting the stage for an explosive confrontation. The characters reflect on their underhanded tactics and find enjoyment in the unfolding chaos, hinting at a deeper strategic game at play."

The character exclaims, That’s not even anywhere close! The level of an archmage! If he’s using the Body Strengthening Art freely, he's not someone I can defeat! Realizing the threat, he considers escaping but acknowledges, I made sure of it in case you tried to escape. It becomes clear that the rival has grown too powerful surprisingly quickly, leading them to question, What on earth happened in the arrangement?As the action unfolds, the character reflects on past experiences, recalling being tied up forty years ago. The seal wasn’t strong, but seeing as how it lasted this long... someone must have recast it. With renewed resolve, he thinks about using the captive Ice General's situation to his advantage.Another voice enters the narrative, revealing their mission: The mission given to me was to help the Blood Wolf King unite the Black Snowfield and capture the Ice General. This complexity adds depth, as it highlights internal conflicts within their organization: If it weren't for him, my mission would’ve already been completed...As the opposing forces weigh their options, one character notes, This is a good opportunity, while another acknowledges the rising threat of the Mere human who possesses the powers of an ice master they never expected to confront.The chapter closes with rising tension as they face each other, setting the stage for an intense conflict between humans and supernatural beings."

One character shares, We're pretty screwed, highlighting the dire situation posed by Grigori's experiments in the human world.Confessions are made regarding past actions, with a character admitting, I’m the one who killed Kaya, setting up future confrontations. As danger looms, strategies form: Spread out and surround the area so the infiltrator can't escape! The urgency mounts as one realizes that their plans are jeopardized, questioning if they can find a solution amid overwhelming odds.

A character expresses their disbelief: “I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO, BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING WITH THAT.” They plan to steal a strength-enhancing ability from someone’s memories, intending to capitalize on it. The tone shifts as another character threatens, “I'LL SHRED YOUR SOUL INTO PIECES.”As the conflict intensifies, one character recalls being attacked by the Blood Wolf King, wondering, “Why are you suddenly acting like that?” This confusion arises amidst growing chaos, “I remember getting attacked by the Blood Wolf King…What just happened to me?” Meanwhile, the Blood Wolf King entangles itself deeper into the conflict, indicating wrath towards their enemies and showcasing immense power.The dynamic changes when a character notes the power dynamics at play: “The Ice General’s cold wave is no match for the Blood Wolf King’s strength.” There’s a strategizing moment as another character muses about utilizing this chaos to their advantage, suggesting “You can’t just let this opportunity slip away!” As allegiances blur, one character questions, “What are you trying to do? Where are you bringing the ice crystal?” while realizing that the scheming involves both the Ice General and the Blood Wolf King: “You didn’t think we were on the same side, did you?” The chapter culminates in a battle of wits and powers, setting up an epic clash fueled by betrayal and manipulation."

The Fox declares, It seems you've always had an ill-fated relationship with my household. Let's end that relationship here. This sets a serious tone, foreshadowing impending conflict. Meanwhile, there are hints of self-doubt and expectation as a young leader, reminiscent of a tiger, expresses concerns about the betrayal from those who were once allies. Please don’t be too nervous. You’re a tiger, the king of the mountains. Show us how dignified a tiger can be. Even with encouragement, the pressure mounts: Those people have betrayed Anthromorph and bared their fangs against us for a long time now.As characters reflect on their pasts, a powerful figure muses on the strength gained from enduring hardship, stating, Even if you keep absorbing the Ice General's power, it doesn’t mean she’s getting weaker. The stakes are impossible; while their strength grows, so does the understanding of their opponents.A figure grapples with resentment, saying, If only they never existed...I tried to become the 'King'…but an enormous wall stood in my way. This reveals deep struggles and aspirations that fuel their ambition.Finally, as the narrative shifts towards determination and despair, someone contemplates the weight of their choices: I threw away what I learned for centuries and got involved with a forbidden power. The chapter captures the complexity of striving for power and the inevitable confrontations that arise from unresolved conflicts. Overall, this chapter combines themes of power, betrayal, and resilience, as the characters navigate a world filled with danger and uncertainty."

Characters reflect on the lessons learned from the Ice General. Elric explains, “After he absorbs a seal, he sees memories that help him understand the owner.” This leads them to consider the Ice General's past: she was not always hostile. Elric reminisces, “The Ice General... wasn’t hostile toward humans at first. She was full of curiosity, like a newborn.” However, due to misunderstandings and her powers, her innocent desires to play with the village children resulted in fear and hostility. “She simply wanted to play with them,” but instead, her approach froze everything around her, leading her to become isolated and filled with resentment. As the characters delve deeper into the Ice General's memories, it's revealed, “She thought the world was hostile toward her,” which shaped her into a monster. Despite her frightening exterior, “there was something that she wanted in her heart,” which was simply to play—a nuance lost amid her tragic circumstances.The chapter wraps up with a realization—protecting the fields and temple could be approached through a simple game, highlighting loneliness as a shared struggle between them. “Maybe the solution should have been obvious,” they ponder, acknowledging the profound connection formed through shared experiences of isolation, much like Elric’s bond with the Ice General. The air becomes lighter, signaling hope for transformation, as they engage in a playful game of tag, illustrating the joys of friendship and restitution."

Elric, confident yet aware of the risks, insists on prioritizing others, despite their warnings about the formidable opponent they face. The aftermath of the battle is felt deeply, as characters reflect on the fallen Fury Tribe and the defeat of the Ice General. There's a mixed sense of accomplishment and foreboding as they recognize the challenges ahead in rebuilding the Tiger King family and uniting the Snowfield. A spirit of hope is ignited with the arrival of Spring, symbolizing new beginnings, fueled by the flower fragrances that dispel winter. The dialogue reinforces the importance of teamwork and gratitude for the support they've received in overcoming adversities.Concerns linger about the future, with hints of danger still lurking. The dialogue suggests that the defeat of the Blood Wolf King and the Ice General isn't the end of their troubles, as past investments and complacency might lead to unforeseen consequences. Elric's plans to fully complete “Winter” alongside rising tensions foreshadow new challenges that they will soon face."

As they discuss, one character laments, “To think he’s already absorbed a 'general'-ranked talent. He really stole Winter and is controlling it.” The overwhelming power drawing in the energies of Winter raises alarms, as another notes, “What an immense amount of mana...” indicating that the situation is spiraling out of control. Doubts about Elric's safety arise as it’s revealed that “his body will break down because of his mana going berserk” due to the stresses imposed by the absorbed power. The urgency escalates, “I need to... ENDURE THIS... NO MATTER WHAT...” reflecting their desperation.The interactions showcase conflicting relationships, particularly between characters who once regarded each other as enemies. “You’re very kind. And to think I’ve only treated you as an enemy...” signals a shift, leading to a unity fueled by the shared goal against a common threat. As one character reflects on their past mistakes, realizing, “If I had approached her by trying to understand her like you did... maybe she wouldn’t have been hurt this much,” there’s a call for deeper understanding in their world.Amidst preparations for the future, an argument arises over who is worthy of possessing Winter. The insistence on readiness is palpable, “You need to build a more robust foundation first,” which introduces a sense of urgency against a backdrop of rising external threats. Ultimately, the chapter closes with a promise of guidance and resources as one character firmly declares, “Come to my private residence. All the materials needed to complete the true Winter are...” setting the stage for further developments and conflicts ahead."

The dialogue emphasizes the importance of protecting their king and the warrior spirit of the beastmen. One character expresses their desire to take on risks alone, asserting, “Before I'm your apprentice, I'm a patriarch who leads my household,” underscoring their responsibility to prove themselves. They recognize their fate as a merbinger, determined to overcome challenges on their own.Tensions rise as demonic energy intensifies in the air, a sign of the potential return of a Demon King. A character grapples with the difficulty of approaching this threat, stating, “If I leave her be, another 'Demon King' might be born again.” They are desperate to exploit any chance they may have, determined that “even if I have to use up all my mana, I must end her in one attack.” However, they feel the weight of past energies stirred by recent events, recognizing a link to their suppressed powers. The chapter concludes with a sense of urgency and determination, as they realize the significance of this moment in the ongoing battle against darkness."
