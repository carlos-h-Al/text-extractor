One person, frustrated, insists they must grab weapons and confront their bizarre surroundings, questioning if this is all just a prank. They struggle to comprehend the situation, with a splitting headache adding to their confusion. Amidst the panic, a mysterious figure welcomes them to the Other World and reveals they have been chosen as heroes to save a dying continent. The figure explains they must pass a tutorial to earn a chance to leave their cramped prison and proceed. As emotions run high, disbelief is rampant in response to the absurdity of the situation—but the reality of their new world starts to sink in as they receive status windows revealing their abilities and ranks. Lee Kiyoung checks his status, only to find that his talents are rated the worst, suggesting a bleak future where he may struggle to even achieve mediocrity. The chapter builds tension with a mix of desperation and disbelief as they grapple with their fate in this strange new realm."

Ena urges everyone to quickly brandish their weapons. We can’t just go down like that; we need to try something! Despite the chaos, there's a hint of camaraderie as one character delivers a refreshing remark, albeit shakily. Let's get out of here, but there’s confusion as another protests, questioning the plan to fight when escape seems plausible.As the characters assess their dire circumstances, they realize they must figure out their surroundings before making any further moves. Discussions unfold around the game-like environment they're trapped in, with mentions of status windows, classes, and the need to level up through battle. It’s probably a system where you can raise your stats if you kill monsters here.Their survival skills serve them well, highlighting the presence of weapons, shields, and supplies. One character suddenly discerns, That monster can’t see well...! We can kill it. So they take the initiative and engage the beast, drawing determination from each other. If I can do it then you can do it as well. No, you can do even better than me.With new roused confidence, they introduce themselves to one another, after which they set their collective sights on escaping the current predicament and improving their status. As they prepare for the next challenge, a hint of hope arises with the discovery of a character possessing legendary magical abilities, raising the stakes even higher for their adventure ahead. The chapter concludes with the characters ready to fight, determined to survive and overcome the madness of their situation."

As they navigate their surroundings, they express their concerns and observations about each other. Kim Hyunsung introduces himself as a powerful regressor, prompting curiosity and admiration from Park Deokgoo and Kiyoung Hyung-nim, who notice his exceptional fighting skills. Deokgoo remarks, You seem rather familiar with fighting, recognizing Hyunsung's prowess.After a successful battle against monsters, Hyunsung reveals that he is gathering survivors and has set up a camp for them, raising questions about the amount of help they can provide. Deokgoo expresses skepticism, stating, Even if you gather their kind, don't you know how much of a bother they'd become? Yet, Hyunsung's reputation as the Regressor of Altanus makes it clear that maintaining good relations with him could be beneficial.The chapter ends with a focus on their plans to unite those willing to fight against the threats surrounding them, highlighting the importance of teamwork in this new world. With each character presenting their strengths and backgrounds, they start to form bonds that will be crucial for their survival against the challenges ahead."

Deokgoo introduces himself and others, like **Jung Hayan**, while feeling competitive about the strength and abilities of those present, questioning their potential in combat. Hayan seems to show interest in the group's dynamics, asking Deokgoo if he has captured many monsters, to which he proudly agrees, crediting Kiyoung for his success.As they settle in, tension arises about the group's situation and resources. **Hyunsung** expresses concern about the shelter's dwindling rations and the struggle they face with inadequate manpower to fend off monsters, suggesting that they might be a burden. Kiyoung, however, insists that they are not a burden and argues for staying and helping because he believes in the group's ability to survive together.The discussion delves into themes of sacrifice and personal motivations. Kiyoung reveals his reluctance to sacrifice himself for the group while emphasizing a desire for independence rather than selflessness. Hyunsung acknowledges this perspective, agreeing that not everyone is inclined to altruism. As tensions about survival and group dynamics simmer, the chapter ends with hints of upcoming challenges and the importance of cooperation amidst their differing views."

We'd like to be included as well... so you already knew about that strange notification, one character comments, pointing to the choices of Attack and Survival. Another responds, If your goal is to survive and not attack, it makes sense to gather non-combatant survivors. The tension rises as characters reflect on their strengths and roles. He’s aware that I’m not that strong, but maybe he thinks I might be useful, one suggests, contemplating their utility in the group. As they strategize, another insists, I've already got the food, at least there aren’t as many monsters near the start point.Discussion shifts to the classes they can unlock: There’s Warrior, Archer, and Magician, one states, while another excitedly shares about the rare-grade Commander class. Isn't Hyung-nim totally the commander? one remarks, emphasizing how well their leader would fit this role.Think of you at the back being all cool and waving your hand, another character teases, fueling the hesitation over choosing classes. With exuberance, they jokingly proclaim, Commander! Please command me! The chapter concludes with a playful yet serious inquiry: Which one did you pick? as the characters ponder their paths forward in this perilous scenario."

Kiyoung explains, I wanted to be a Commander at first, but I decided on Magician because it has higher intelligence. His companion responds, But why not Archer? You could improve your body with that class! Kiyoung retorts, I’m not used to physical activity; it wouldn't be a good choice for me. Meanwhile, Deokgoo contemplates his class options, revealing, I’m thinking about becoming a Shield Warrior or a Priest but I’m unsure. Kiyoung encourages him, stating, A Shield Warrior sounds great! You’ve made a solid choice. As they plan their next steps, the group discusses food rations. Two is enough for us, Kiyoung asserts, while another chimes in, You should go and feed people! A bit of banter ensues about Hyunsung's tardiness in returning, with HyeYoung impatiently waiting and asking for food.Amidst the distractions, Jung Hayan is also mentioned, with a hint of someone taking care of her due to her feeble state. There's a playful dynamic established among the characters, highlighting their camaraderie and the struggles they're navigating in the game world. The chapter closes with a sense of urgency as everyone is urged to hurry, fearing possible monster raids. Kiyoung sends someone to check on Hayan’s well-being, reinforcing the group's commitment to looking after each other in challenging times."

Mizu expresses her outrage and disbelief at a certain bastard who dares to approach her precious treasure. She contemplates the motivations behind the sudden kindness of another character, suspecting ulterior motives linked to survival.Amidst this turmoil, Hayan finds herself enveloped in the drama, caught between two suitors. One of them, Kiyoung, expresses a desire to deepen their relationship, but Hayan seems taken aback by his sudden interest. Their conversation hints that Hayan might have feelings for him, but the dynamics are tense.Confusion continues when a confrontation breaks out due to a misunderstanding involving Deokwoo and Seokwoo. Deokwoo is accused of in-group violence for grabbing Hayan's arm, but he insists it's a misunderstanding. Tensions reach a boiling point as characters demand clarity about their intentions and feelings, leading to emotional outbursts.Hayan finds herself caught in the middle, feeling pressured and misrepresented as the people around her misinterpret the situation. The characters grapple with vulnerability and misguided heroism as Hayan is urged to stand up for herself, and she struggles with the consequences of others' actions as everyone tries to determine who is the real victim.The chapter concludes with the discord unresolved, as misunderstandings and emotional turmoil cloud the relationships among the characters."

Hayan reveals she has two older sisters but hasn't seen them in a long time, which deepens their bond. Ki-young suggests they should talk more comfortably with each other, indicating his desire to know her better.The scene then shifts dramatically as a conflict erupts, with Jihye confronting an alleged assault involving Yoo Seok-woo. Ki-young defends Seok-woo, arguing that the situation is misunderstood and that Hayan wouldn't act violently. Tensions rise as Jihye and others corner Seok-woo, prompting Ki-young to urge everyone to reflect on their actions rather than simply follow the crowd.As the chaos unfolds, Hayan expresses her distress over the situation, feeling blamed and pressured. Ki-young reassures her, acknowledging how tough it has been for her. Hayan, moved by Ki-young's unwavering support, reflects on his kindness, questioning why he has been so helpful. Ki-young simply states he acted on his own principles of what is right, leaving the impression that he genuinely cares for her well-being.The chapter encapsulates themes of empathy, conflict resolution, and the development of trusting relationships amidst chaos."

Days later, Jihye apologizes sincerely, and it seems Kiyoung’s attitude toward Hayan has shifted, leading to rumors about his feelings for her. The dialogue reveals Jihye’s political savvy as she manipulates the environment, creating a sense of unity amongst them. Meanwhile, Hayan experiences growth as she learns magic, expressing gratitude towards Kiyoung for his guidance. Kiyoung encourages her, emphasizing the importance of imagination in magic. The chapter closes with surprise as it’s revealed that Hayan has advanced to the magician class, which surprises Kiyoung and suggests her potential is greater than he realized. Overall, the chapter highlights themes of trust, personal growth, and the complexities of relationships among the characters."

The chapter opens with a character expressing frustration about mastering magic, saying, “AH, SORRY. I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE... HOW TO MANIPULATE MAGIC POWER, RIGHT?” Another character tries to reassure them, noting, “THERE’S NO WAY SHE WOULD HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY LEARNING MAGIC.” Despite this encouragement, there are challenges ahead, prompting one to ask, “C-CAN YOU HELP ME FOR A LITTLE LONGER?”As discussions on the upcoming hunt emerge, one character expresses their desire to join, saying, “I WAS WONDERING IF I CAN BE PART OF IT.” However, there's conflict regarding recommendations as someone else is preferred first. A friend interjects, pushing them to consider their abilities, “AREN'T I BETTER THAN THAT LITTLE KID?” Meanwhile, dynamics between characters take center stage as jealousy arises. One character muses about the affection shown by a male companion, leading to confusion and insecurity, “I FEEL SORRY FOR LYING TO HIM… BUT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET HIS ATTENTION.” The dialogue turns confrontational, with one character berating another, “YOU’RE EASY TO USE AND THROW,” highlighting the competitive rivalry over the attention of Lee Kiyoung.Conflicted feelings lead to a dramatic climax, with a painful confrontation where one character desperately claims, “PLEASE STAY WITH ME, PLEASE… I DON'T LIKE HER! IT HURTS.” This plea underscores the emotional turmoil as characters grapple with unreciprocated love and friendships that threaten to fracture under pressure. The chapter closes on a note of heightened emotions, foreshadowing potential conflicts ahead as loyalties and affections are put to the test."

Tensions rise when a member warns others to stop mistreating Hayan, creating a sense of conflict among group dynamics.

His anxiety is palpable as he questions how to cope with the unknown.**Maey** is concerned about **Miss Hyeyoung**, inquiring, “What happened to her?” As the group assesses the aftermath, **Hayan** describes the shocking scene, saying, “When I regained my senses, Miss Hyeyoung... was like this.” The discovery of her injuries raises suspicions about the dungeon's traps, as they deduce that she may have triggered something.**Baaik** ponders the consequences, stating, These cuts are too clean... this is the best choice, as guilt creeps in while they contemplate leaving Hyeyoung behind for their own safety. Nonetheless, he insists, “We can’t just leave Miss Hyeyoung like that. Let’s do at least this much for her.”Their predicament is further complicated by the presence of nearby monsters, leading them to decide, “Let’s quickly get back to camp.” The group’s dynamics show their support for one another, with **Deokgoo** feeling anxious about being alone but trusting **Hayan** to stay vigilant while they explore.Later, they reflect on their growth, with **Kiyoung** noting, Much of your growth has been centered around strength, magic, and intelligence. Despite their hardships, there's a subtle acknowledgment of their improvement, with Kiyoung confidently stating, “This isn't a bad situation,” appreciating their increased stats, yet feeling guilty about how they survived.In a poignant exchange, **Hayan** reassures **Baaik**, saying, “I’m glad you didn’t get hurt...

Jinho notes the tension surrounding Hyun-Sung, prompting others to question what could be causing it. They speculate that Jinho, in a past life, was connected to Hyun-Sung, adding depth to their encounter.Amidst the introductions, Lee Kiyoung returns, and there's a mix of excitement and caution among the group. Kiyoung shares that he has heard Jinho has grown stronger, demonstrating the bond and respect among the survivors. However, the atmosphere turns tense as Kiyoung mentions hearing rumors about human hunters in the area, hinting at a darker situation. There’s an acknowledgment of their precarious existence as they navigate alliances and the lurking threats around them.Kiyoung's commentary about the newcomers brings to light their immediate distrust and fear, especially when it comes to potential dangers in this new environment. The chapter ends with a sharp recognition of their circumstances, blending camaraderie and wariness as they all strive to survive in a world fraught with peril."

Kim Hyunsung introduces himself as a murderer, both literally and figuratively hinting at the dark past tied to his new acquaintance, Jung Jinho. Hyunsung is approached with admiration from Lee Gicheol and Lee Kiyoung, who express interest in his camp's resources, particularly their survivors. Gicheol carefully observes Hyunsung's demeanor, suspecting underlying tensions due to his history with Jung Jinho. The conversation shifts as Hyunsung and his group welcome the newcomers but keep a cautious distance, suggesting that they view them as potential threats.As the group prepares to tour the camp, Hyunsung reflects on their shared complexities and the recent tragedies they've faced, including Hye-young's fate at the hands of a mysterious magic trap. This incident unveils more about Hyunsung's protective instincts and reinforces the theme of mistrust among allies in a world surrounded by dangers. Hyunsung’s cool resolve reassures others of his capability, but it’s clear that deeper mysteries, including the presence of a psychopathic killer, loom over them, setting the stage for future conflicts and evaluations of trust within their ranks."

One character reflects, It's obvious, but after that incident, I didn't say things like Jung Jinho is suspicious, indicating an awareness of the delicate situation surrounding Park Hyeyoung's death. Kim Hyunsung is depicted as vigilant, watching over key figures, while the narrator contemplates the impending conflict, recognizing Jung Jinho as the one who killed Park Hyeyoung, asserting that there's no reason for the regressor to not get rid of him.Plans are being made to raid the underground dungeon with reinforcements, as they ponder the potential division within their ranks. If we go with the members that I've just mentioned, then it’s obvious that the parties will split into Jung Jinho’s and Kim Hyunsung’s party. There are concerns about ensuring that no more accidents like Park Hyeyoung's death occur.As characters prepare for the dungeon raid, Hyunsung and others strategize, stating, Let’s try going to that dungeon together, emphasizing teamwork despite mistrust. Jung Jinho's character is portrayed as both diligent and underappreciated, as allies poke fun at his tireless efforts, Jinho-ssi, you’re so amazing! Thank you for helping us.Frequent banter and camaraderie arise amidst the seriousness, with characters expressing mixed feelings about their new alliance. But even so, raiding dungeons is the top priority for now, demonstrating a focus on immediate goals over personal relationships, while tensions with characters like Yoo Seokwoo linger in the background.In summary, as they prepare for the upcoming raid while grappling with past betrayals and misunderstandings, the stage is set for confrontation and potential revelations about trust, loyalty, and the true nature of their alliances."

They excitedly discuss the unique accessories inside, including a powerful bracelet and shield ring, with a sense of gratitude toward Hyunsung for sharing them. Hyunsung expresses his desire for them to journey together, promoting camaraderie among the group, even as Deokgoo harbors some skepticism about Hyunsung's motives. Deokgoo acknowledges his lack of special skills compared to others and contemplates his role within the team.As they prepare for their journey, the characters express concerns about potential enemies among their new allies, particularly Jung Jinho's group. Still, they're motivated by the opportunity to clear a dungeon, which could lead to their survival. The chapter ends with a light-hearted moment as they ponder their pasts and relationships, hinting at budding connections among the characters. Upon entering the dungeon, they're thrust into a compulsory quest, heightening the tension and anticipation for what lies ahead."

Amidst chaos, one character, Ilst, attempts to rally everyone by casting fire magic, calling it Blazing Demon.Kim Hyunsung steps in, curious about their strength, affirming confidence in their abilities as the group recognizes the severity of their opponents. Despite the intimidation posed by the evolved demons, Hyunsung's actions anchor the others, reinforcing their determination to fight. They discuss strategy, with a sense of reliance on Hyunsung as they navigate their decisions in battle.Hayan emerges as a crucial ally, skillfully directing the flow of battle by luring monsters away from her team, while the others express gratitude for her support. Tension rises as they realize they need to stay focused and united, reminding each other of the importance of staying alive for their loved ones waiting back home.As the battle rages on, there’s palpable urgency among the characters to gather their strength and support one another. They rally for a final push, urging Hayan to recharge her magic quickly amidst the chaotic spectacle. In a moment of sheer determination, they collectively shout their encouragement, embodying the spirit of teamwork against the impending doom."

Despite feeling responsible, she steels herself, noting that the intensity in her eyes is returning. Seokwoo, on the other hand, is provocatively challenged, leading to a tense standoff as they plan to divert attention for a sneak attack. Hayan cheekily asserts, “Provocation is my specialty,” before fueling Seokwoo's jealousy, declaring, “You're so jealous, you're about to die, right?”As they gear up for battle, Seokwoo attempts to help Hayan, but she insists on handling it herself. Their strategic positioning is clear, and Hayan prepares to confront the monsters, stating, “I won’t overdo it. Don’t worry about me.” The dynamics shift as Seokwoo transforms into a villain in their eyes, as Hayan declares, “This is all to turn Yoo Seokwoo into a villain!” The tension peaks with Seokwoo enduring punches, resolute, saying, “I can endure it. This is all to turn Yoo Seokwoo into a villain!”The chapter climaxes with a surprise victory for Jinho against a weak enemy, but the victory only fuels conflict among their ranks, as accusations fly and loyalty is questioned, culminating in “You killed him! You killed Kichul!” This sets the stage for further confrontation and conflict within and outside their party."

He notes the cold-hearted nature of their world, whether on Earth or here. Seokwoo is determined to take down **Lee Kiyoung**, asserting, I’m going only after I end that bastard, Lee Kiyoung's life.Meanwhile, **Hayan** and **Kichul's** fates weigh heavily on the group. As **Deokgoo** shows vulnerability about his inability to help, he apologizes fervently, I’m sorry my body is so slow, Hyung-nim. His distress prompts reassurance from others who have their own struggles and anger towards betrayal—especially towards those who have abandoned them like **Jung Jinho**.In a tense confrontation, Seokwoo angrily asserts that he won't forgive **Hayan** or the other betrayers, vowing, I’ll make her regret not choosing me. Meanwhile, their adversaries mock the situation, ridiculing the chaos unfolding, You didn’t receive an order or something from Jung Jinho? That the plan is off because Kichul died.Tensions escalate as characters clash, revealing vulnerabilities and hidden motivations. **Lee Kiyoung** taunts **Deokgoo**, exposing the loyalty issues within their ranks. The situation pushes them toward a fatal confrontation, with motivations of revenge and the primal instinct to survive becoming prevalent. **Kiyoung** chillingly states, “In this world, we either kill or be killed,” suggesting that their moral compass is fully entangled in survival.As the chapter closes, the struggle between camaraderie and betrayal deepens, setting the stage for future conflicts fueled by anger, revenge, and the quest for power."

Hyung-nim is urged, Hyung-nim, are you still thinking about which class you should choose? Just choose the one that sounds best! This reflects their struggle with choice amidst emotional distress. As they discuss their feelings about Yoo Seokwoo, one character expresses regret: I did it without realizing it. T-I’m sorry. They comfort each other with words like, Everything is alright now... please don’t cry, illustrating the supportive atmosphere despite their previous anger.The group reflects on their experiences: We will meet similar cruel people again in the future, showing a shared understanding of their challenging world. They bond over their mutual hardships, acknowledging, It looks like all of us have gotten closer and tighter.As they choose their classes, various options are presented, such as Summoner, Magic Lancer, Black Magician, Alchemist, and Flame Magician. Kiyoung-ssi weighs his options, noting, Your magic power is... not really on the high side, leading him to consider safer paths like Alchemist over Black Magician. In a supportive debate, one character encourages Kiyoung-ssi on his possible paths: The Alchemist might actually be a good choice. The chapter ends with a push for Hyung-nim to be a Black Magician amidst the friendly argument, showcasing their camaraderie and care for each other's paths."

Character 1 exclaims, “Someone who can obliterate monsters with darkness...” while picturing Hyung-nim as a powerful Black Magician. However, another responds, “The Black Magician doesn’t really suit someone as noble as Hyung-nim.” Despite this, another insists, “He must become a Black Magician!” Amidst the banter, Hyung-nim’s decision looms. He’s offered a “present” to sway his choice: a hero-grade item that he cannot open. “This isn’t a present, it’s bribery!” someone retorts, sparking more jokes about Hyung-nim’s past abilities.As his friends argue their cases, Hyung-nim mulls it over. Ultimately, he decides on becoming an Alchemist, stating, “I think an Alchemist would be good,” and thanks his friends for their support, indicating that he wants to live up to their expectations.The chapter concludes with a sense of camaraderie as they prepare for their next challenge, anticipating the exit of the tutorial dungeon and the excitement of what lies ahead. They acknowledge their progress, stating, I think we've reached the last stage of the tutorial dungeon, solidifying a teamwork spirit as they step towards new adventures."

Hyunsung notes how everyone seems relaxed now compared to earlier when they were worried about escaping the dungeon. They discover a locked door that won't budge, leading to speculation that they must meet specific conditions to open it. There's a hint about injecting mana into a magic circle, which Hyunsung tests, successfully unlocking the door.They encounter the dungeon's administrator, who introduces herself as the vice guildmaster of the Blue Guild. She explains that her duty is to guide survivors and help them adapt to their new life while also searching for others still trapped in the dungeon. Participants are informed that the dungeon door is only open for three days after conquering the area, which raises questions about the dungeon's mechanics.As they prepare to leave, the administrator requests their weapons for safety. While assessing team member Lee Sanghee's stats, they're impressed by her abilities but find her demeanor humble. There's a moment of nostalgia when Hyunsung reflects on not saying goodbye to Lee Jihye properly. As the chapter wraps up, they share camaraderie over a feast, signaling the end of their immediate struggles in the dungeon and the beginning of a new chapter in their journey."

They discuss the importance of teamwork and how everyone played their roles effectively, particularly highlighting the safety of a shelter they established for survivors.As they navigate their new environment, they encounter a welcoming guild called Blue, led by a charismatic vice guildmaster who pulls out all the stops for a grand banquet to honor the newcomers. However, suspicions arise as the group wonders if the guild's kindness is merely a strategy to recruit them. They introduce themselves, leading to a mix of camaraderie and wariness, with one character humorously suspecting he might be seen as a mere potion factory due to his alchemist class.The guild members express their eagerness to recruit the newcomers, offering favorable terms but not revealing everything they want to know. A sense of unease hangs over the group, especially from one member who recalls a previous life where trust led to betrayal and servitude. They resolve to remain vigilant, questioning the guild's true intentions and preparing to make informed choices about their future alliances."

They highlight the coexistence of different races, including elves, dragons, and lizardmen, alongside humans.**Mine:** The land known as the Continent isn't just the Holy Empire of Benigor but also the Republic and the Kingdom Alliance. We maintain a balance between our countries.**Lee Sanghee, a member of the Blue Guild, explains the role of free guilds** in the tutorial system: We’re like recruiters trying to bring you into our company.A character expresses skepticism about this arrangement: **“Aren't we being bribed with all this food?”** To which Sanghee reassures them about their sincerity, though others suspect hidden agendas.**Hyunsung, a prominent player, reflects a sense of caution:** Even if they seem honest, are they just showing us a façade?The chapter unfolds as the group contemplates the offers from the Blue Guild and the underlying motives at play. Hyunsung considers the future and potential repercussions of their choices: **“Going back to the Blue Guild might be the key to succeeding in my second life.”**As they prepare for negotiations, there's a palpable tension about their decision-making. **“We have nothing to lose; we’ll choose the side that benefits us the most,”** one character asserts, ready to weigh their options carefully.The chapter ends with a tense cliffhanger, hinting at challenges ahead: **“The masked people are here again… Humans will eventually be annihilated.”** The characters are left contemplating the significance of their decisions, foreshadowing future conflicts and alliances."

As they converse, Kiyoung appears nervous, questioning whether this is merely an interview or also a test of his abilities. He acknowledges his relatively low magic power stat, which leads to gossip among the guild members about his worth. Despite the negative opinions voiced by others, Kiyoung is reminded of the perks offered by the guild, including a substantial contract with a long duration, insurance, and research facilities, which he finds appealing. He reflects on the condescending treatment he receives and realizes that being treated poorly could actually work to his advantage, allowing him to prove his potential.During discussions about his contract, the members of the guild argue about the financial aspects, expressing doubt over Kiyoung's value due to his alchemist background. Kiyoung, however, remains optimistic and expresses that he would like more time to consider the offer after they propose he consult with his teammates.In a moment of insight, Kiyoung realizes that the guild is trying to secure not just him, but also his friends who are skilled fighters, seemingly assessing the dynamics and possible advantages of recruiting the whole team instead of just one member. Toward the end, they hand him manuscript materials to help with his decision, leaving him to think about their offer over the next few days while contemplating his future. The chapter ends with a sense of uncertainty, both for Kiyoung’s decision and the guild's hopes in securing a promising member amidst their internal discord."

One character reflects on the importance of the upcoming demonstration, feeling the pressure not to let Hayan down. They know this will be a chance for Hayan to grow more independent and prepare for future challenges. Amidst the discussions, there's an acknowledgment of the support they're receiving and a potential career shift. It might be a little early for such a decision… suggests one, contemplating the benefits of a more secure position rather than joining a larger guild. The camaraderie among the group is evident as they strategize on how to prove their worth at the demonstration.There's also a personal touch with characters expressing feelings of neglect and concern over Hayan’s recent struggles. One of them notes, “Have I been too neglectful lately?” highlighting a sense of responsibility toward her well-being. Jung Hayan is depicted as feeling lonely and in need of reassurance, wanting to spend time with her companions. Despite acknowledging her emotional dependency, there's an underlying plan to support her growth through tough love and encouragement. One character expresses determination to ensure that Hayan shines by focusing on her studies, saying, “We’ll meet after you get a perfect score.”As the chapter progresses, the group rallies together with a shared goal, emphasizing their collective commitment to the upcoming demonstration while navigating personal dynamics and individual growth."

Members rush to their designated spots, filled with anticipation and excitement. A character expresses their relief at the new game dynamics compared to the tutorial, reminiscing about the previous struggles but feeling a sense of protection now.Suddenly, Vice Guildmaster Lee Sanghee addresses the attendees, reflecting on their journey from the tutorial dungeon to this grand event. She emphasizes the significance of new heroes emerging in this land with much appreciation toward the guests present. The crowd cheers as the raiding team receives recognition for their efforts in clearing the dungeon quickly.Amidst the excitement, one character notices another struggling, spotting a nosebleed, and worries that she might have overexerted herself during practice. The tension rises as Jung Hayan, the new raiding team member, prepares for her demonstration. Self-doubt weighs heavily on her as she fears disappointing her ally, feeling the pressure of proving herself.As the demonstration begins, Hayan impresses everyone with her magical abilities, astonishing the crowd and catching the attention of various guilds who clamour for her to join them. The chapter concludes with fervent excitement surrounding Hayan, showcasing her potential as a genius magician and setting the stage for future adversities and alliances."

The spotlight shifts to Kiyoung, who is recognized for his impressive growth and unique magic talent, although there’s a hint of parasitic dependency on Hayan's innate abilities. The group discusses their capabilities while expressing concerns about distractions that could lead to injuries.As they interact, Hayan confidently claims her connection with Kiyoung, making it clear she intends to showcase their bond. There’s playful banter about finding love among the group, though sparring sessions take precedence. In the midst of the excitement, the promise of a spar between experienced swordsmen adds anticipation, with secret strategies unfolding as they wish to avoid unnecessary attention.Amidst the admiration of their prowess, there's an underlying plot about maintaining a low profile to avoid suspicions. Viewers witness not only the power dynamics and strong alliances but also affirmations of loyalty within their group—as they emphasize that the true pride of their party surpasses initial assumptions and is yet to be revealed. The chapter concludes with a sense of mystery surrounding this ‘true pride,’ setting the stage for intriguing developments ahead."

The initial dialogue reveals admiration for a cunning regressor who demonstrated impressive skill while holding back. Everyone is encouraged to stay in their seats to hear about the next participant, Park Deokgoo, a vital tank for their raid. After some nervous chatter, Deokgoo prepares to face a tutorial monster, assured by his comrades that he'll do well.As the demonstrations progress, the tension builds around Lee Kiyoung, an alchemist with rare talents joining the raid. He contemplates not showing anything new, feeling pressure from executives aware of his capabilities. Despite his concerns about expensive catalysts, he aims to impress, even if it drains his stamina.After a successful set of demonstrations, chaos ensues as multiple guild representatives rush to recruit Lee Kiyoung and Jung Hayan, showcasing a suddenly intense competition for their allegiance. They are offered tempting deals, leading to questions about loyalty and true power dynamics within the guilds. The chapter culminates in a flurry of proposals, friendships, and the brewing rivalry as alliances form amidst the eager recruiters. The tone shifts to anxiety and determination as characters navigate the complex web of relationships and ambitions, setting the stage for conflicts and partnerships in the upcoming challenges."

Kiyoung is taken aback by her overwhelming strength and mysterious stats, while Heera expresses her excitement over potential new recruits, specifically Kiyoung and Hayan. Kiyoung is mesmerized by the lucrative offer presented by Heera—2 billion Korean won per person, which is significantly higher than other guild offers. Despite the initial shock, he considers the opportunity carefully, especially since Heera views magicians as valuable assets to her guild. Hayan, feeling shy, catches Kiyoung’s attention as he tries to calm her nerves amidst their awkward introduction.As Heera highlights her guild's need for magical talent, she aims to recruit Kiyoung and Hayan specifically for a new project, but desires to keep their close-knit group intact, which complicates the decision. Despite the temptations and pressures from Heera, Kiyoung feels a sense of loyalty to his friends, insisting that they all stick together.The encounter takes a threatening turn when Heera warns Kiyoung about his killing intent, showcasing her strength with a subtle, yet palpable tension. While both Heera and Kiyoung are aware of the stakes involved, Kiyoung successfully navigates the confrontation without burning bridges, leaving Heera intrigued by his character.As the chapter concludes, Kiyoung reflects on the encounter, realizing the potential for alliances while still considering his friends’ ties. The chapter closes with a sense of uncertainty about the path ahead, leaving room for future developments and deeper relationships within the guilds."

Lee Kiyoung's companions express their anger, declaring, “SHE WAS JUST A BRUTE!” at Heera's aggression, yet some see a silver lining, suggesting it might strengthen their ties with her guild despite the conflict.As negotiations proceed, the Blue Guildmaster and Lee Kiyoung explore updating contract terms, with promises of gold and resources offered. Kiyoung, however, presses for better conditions, leading to a flurry of demands: “How much will you raise my terms?” The stakes escalate as they discuss forming a new unit and appointing Kiyoung as the leader of a non-combatant class group.Amidst this, Kiyoung's companions are drawn into a chaotic scene, where threats are exchanged, and the power dynamics shift. “PULL BACK YOUR MAGIC POWER!” one pleads, highlighting the urgency to avoid further escalation. “Killing intent won’t go unnoticed by Heera!” becomes a warning of consequences should things spiral out of control.The chapter culminates in revelations about the relationships within the guilds, especially the fearsome reputation of Cha Heera. Kiyoung hints at connections beyond mere acquaintances, teasing, “I have one more thing to threaten them with,” leaving uncertainty lingering in the air as alliances are questioned. The undercurrent of anxiety about potential ramifications from their choices adds depth to the narrative, setting the stage for future conflicts and character developments."

Hayan pleads with Kiyoung not to leave her, expressing her deep love: I LOVE YOU, KIYOUNG-OPPA. Despite her tears, she understands that for his safety, he must become stronger. Kiyoung shares her sentiment but emphasizes the need to put strength over their relationship for now: That’s why I have to do this. Hayan resolves to train hard because she feels powerless to protect the ones she loves. Determined to strengthen herself to counter the overwhelming challenges posed by Cha Heera, Hayan declares, I MUST BECOME FAR STRONGER THAN HER IN ORDER TO PROTECT OPPA!

Ki-young emphasizes the rising power of Kim Hyunsung’s party, insisting that they'll soon become a key representative of the empire. He proposes that by forming an alliance with the Blue Guild, Heera will have favorable relations and priority access over other guilds. However, Heera questions Ki-young’s assurances, remaining skeptical about his guarantees.Ki-young tries to convince her by showcasing a list of potential magicians from the Blue Guild, suggesting they could be beneficial for her Red Mercenary Guild. Despite his attempts to charm her with the prospect of powerful allies, Heera brushes aside his offers, insisting she has no need for them and is uninterested in sharing loyalties. As the negotiation progresses, it becomes clear that Ki-young isn’t just interested in traditional terms of trade. He makes a bold offer to provide her with a stake in his potion business, recognizing that might pique her interest. Heera, intrigued but still cautious, acknowledges his boldness, indicating she is considering his proposal.The chapter ends with a mix of intrigue and tension, as both characters navigate their motives and the complexities of alliances in their quest for power. They share a moment of flirtation, hinting at an evolving dynamic amidst the backdrop of a larger power struggle."

The Vice Guildmaster gives a motivational speech about surviving and finding one’s path, leading to mixed reactions. A trainee expresses embarrassment at being referred to by a title. There are hints of tension as characters discuss their responsibilities and feelings of abandonment from Kim Hyunsung, who is accused of neglecting his duties towards those who followed him. One trainee passionately voices the disappointment in Hyunsung for not taking care of them, leading to a confrontation among the group.As the story unfolds, it is revealed that there are internal politics within the guild, with discussions about resource allocation and plans for the future. There are mentions of rival guilds, indicating the competitive nature of their world. Characters like Lee Sanghee remind each other of the importance of unity and the necessity to support one another.Simultaneously, there are schemes brewing in the background as one member is warned that plans must ensure Joo Seungjoon doesn’t return alive, which suggests deeper conflicts and mistrust among the guilds. Furthermore, there’s a growing sense of rivalry, as the trainees contemplate their decisions and how to align with powerful figures.Amid the chaos, the atmosphere shifts to one of tension as they prepare for a raid while dealing with personalities that clash. The strategic choices in this chapter hint at future conflicts and alliances, setting up for the next challenges that the characters must face together."

Kyung expresses concern for his companion, urging them to go out and live their own life rather than staying with him, stating, “I think it’d be better for you to go out and live your own life instead of staying together with me.” However, this advice is met with resistance and anger, as the other character is furious, questioning Kyung’s authority and expressing their unwillingness to accept his reasoning.As the dialogue unfolds, tensions rise as Kyung and another character confront the notion of obligation and care, saying, “There’s absolutely no obligation for us to take care of you.” This creates a rift, with accusations flying about who truly contributed to their current situation, highlighting the complexities of their relationships: “Who do you think built the stone wall in the camp?!” Amidst the chaos, there is a melancholic farewell, with a character stating, “It’s a pity to have to call it the end... but this is my gift for everyone here.” This moment is tinged with hope for future meetings, but also a foreboding sense of inevitable discord: “Next time? There won’t be such a thing. Since you guys will start fighting amongst one another and eventually kill yourselves.” The chapter also showcases lighter moments as characters tease and joke while preparing for their journey to Linpel, revealing their camaraderie despite the earlier tension. Hayan's talent is acknowledged when another character expresses awe, “Saw her use it with my own eyes!” Despite their bickering, the characters collectively decide to move forward, hinting at the potential for various developments in their journey ahead.Ultimately, this chapter encapsulates themes of independence, discord, and the importance of companionship in a tumultuous world."

They discuss the demographics of people summoned to different regions, noting the presence of Koreans in Lindel and Taiwanese in Darwan. Amidst the melancholic atmosphere, they begin hunting for a priest, revealing the rarity of such figures.Upon reaching the Blue Guild, there’s a mix of excitement and apprehension as they settle in. Characters joke about the living arrangements, suggesting they might as well be newlyweds, adding humor to their situation. Key discussions emerge about individual spaces, training facilities, and personal rooms, showcasing their camaraderie and the importance of bonding.Kiyoung receives a personalized alchemy lab, sparking joy and determination to prove himself as an alchemist. Deokgoo expresses a desire to celebrate with a meal, while Kiyoung, overwhelmed with experimentation opportunities, prioritizes his studies instead. The chapter concludes with Hyunsung taking the initiative to look for allies in their endeavor, implying that there's more at stake than just their personal growth. They emphasize the importance of not wasting resources, hinting at a deeper mission beyond mere survival."

Dialogue reveals their mixed feelings about the dangerous route they've chosen, with one character expressing embarrassment over their guild recruitment while another observes the lifeless atmosphere in the slums. One character's keen insight triggers an exciting revelation as they tap into their powers, discovering a legendary figure with immense abilities and holy power. The focus shifts to a unique alchemical experiment, emphasizing the importance of careful preparation. A character named Leekiyoung demonstrates confidence in their abilities, confidently skipping traditional methods for direct experimentation.The narrative transitions to a heartwarming domestic scene as Hayan surprises a character with homemade meatballs, leading to humorous exchanges and lighthearted banter about the meal's contents. Although initially perplexed by the food, gratitude and concern for each other shine through as they discuss Hayan's newfound potion-making skills and their potential implications.As the chapter progresses, the characters reflect on their relationships, particularly about their mutual friend Hyunsung, who genuinely cares for those suffering in the slums. Concern for Hyunsung's well-being prompts discussions about teaming up, showcasing their commitment to helping others despite dangers that may lie ahead.Overall, this chapter combines action, character development, and humor, showcasing both the challenges of the outside world and the warmth of personal connections.

']]","In this chapter, heated confrontations unfold as Blue criticizes the elitism of the wealthy, accusing them of creating a cycle of dependency among the poor they claim to help. If those are filthy pigs, then you’re a zookeeper who’s been taming the filthy pigs, Blue asserts, challenging the notion that the poor deserve their plight. As tensions rise, Blue proposes hiring the destitute, offering jobs and better wages, insisting they take responsibility for their lives rather than rely on handouts. Will you really pay us more? Will there be any meat included in the hot meals? the crowd questions, torn between skepticism and hope. However, some remain wary, fearing Blue’s intentions might be a scam.Amidst this chaos, the Black Swan Guild members attempt to extend help but are met with the disdain of others who believe they’ve fabricated their compassion to appeal to a powerful priest among the needy. The priest strongly defends the forgotten individuals as deserving of care and compassion, rebuking slander from those who dismiss their struggles. They are good people, deserving of help, she states, standing firmly against the criticism directed at the impoverished.As the confrontation escalates, underlying themes of class struggle and societal obligation weave through the dialogue. Blue, representing those born into privilege, encounters resistance from the priest who challenges the notion of worth based on strength and talent. You don’t know how hard my life has been, Blue retorts, revealing personal battles that shed light on deeper societal issues.Ultimately, the chapter concludes on a tense note, with accusations flying and differing perspectives on charity and its genuine impact. The characters grapple with their beliefs about worth, responsibility, and the societal systems that define them, setting the stage for further conflict and development."

The priestess, determined to help the underprivileged, confronts the harsh reality of their situation. Priestess: “You’re not going to sit and watch these people, right? They’re nothing more than alcoholic sex offenders!”Noona: “They’re simply underprivileged people holding their own against you, someone with power.”As the dialogue flows, characters share their perspectives, revealing the complexities of their struggles. The blue guild officer, Lee Kiyoung, navigates through competing interests, implying that he sees the residents as mere pawns.Kiyoung: “Those pathetic pigs... if I expose their true selves to the priestess, it will align with my plan!”Noona: “Everyone is part of one big family here. Do not slander them.”The priestess reflects on her motivations and the doubts creeping into her mind as she tries to uplift the downtrodden.Priestess: “I just want to turn Lindel into a beautiful place where the kind don’t have to suffer.”However, Kiyoung’s manipulation and the actions of the residents put her resolve to the test. As the chapter concludes, uncertainty looms about the future of Lindel and the true nature of the people within it.Kiyoung: “Just by making her doubt herself, I have already accomplished half my goal.”Overall, this chapter delves into themes of power, privilege, and the painful dynamics between the underprivileged and those who wish to help."

Kiyeon reveals his plans to use Sun Heeyoung as a pawn against their enemies, declaring, I’ll use them to bring Sun Heeyoung over to our side. This is basically killing two birds with one stone. Meanwhile, concerns arise about impending conflicts among the residents, leading to heated exchanges that expose their mistrust, particularly about the priestess. One character questions the morality of their actions, There’s no way they’re using me. Trust them. However, the others are less certain, voicing doubts about the goodness of the people they interact with. Tension spikes as one character lashes out, You dare act like a social arbiter of justice, you b*tch?! While another insists that, Before I witnessed it for myself, someone who is weak isn’t necessarily a good person, Priestess, indicating a growing realization of underlying harsh truths.The antagonists express frustration about a potential informant, scheming, Obviously, we need to catch him and kill him. This stems from the fear that he might reveal their plot to the guilds. As the group grapples with their actions, one character’s bitter sarcasm punctuates the atmosphere, Just accept your fate and become our handbag.As they consider selling off a captured character as a slave for profit, their conversation reveals their lack of compassion, We could get some good money off of him. Amid the chaos, Kiyeon decides to transform himself into a beautiful woman to bait those he perceives as losers, insisting, Please make my clothes look like the ones they wear around here.The chapter ends with a mix of anticipation and mischief as Kiyeon, now transformed, prepares to move forward with his plan: Shall we go, Hayan? To watch the priestess teach those horny losers a lesson. This shift in attire symbolizes a deeper exploration of deception and manipulation among the characters."

THIS IS A LIE, RIGHT? one voice cries out amidst heated accusations. Characters argue about being called filthy after receiving kindness in the past. I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BECOME SOMEONE WHO WAS LOATHED BY PEOPLE I LOVED, one individual admits, highlighting their internal conflict. As chaos unfolds, a character pleads, PLEASE HELP ME! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP! But others, fueled by anger and betrayal, vow to take drastic action, declaring, WELL, ALRIGHT THEN...IF YOU GUYS JUST DIE HERE, THEN THERE’LL BE NO WITNESSES!Amidst the turmoil, a priestess is desperately trying to save a dying girl. PRIESTESS...KIYEON IS DYING! echoes in the air. While they pray for salvation, one character muses regretfully, I...WAS REALLY TOO FOOLISH, realizing their previous ignorance towards those suffering.Character conflicts rise as one states, “I’M REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU PEOPLE,” challenging the group’s morality. Feelings of guilt and responsibility weigh heavily when someone remembers their past kindness, saying, “YOU SHARED EVERYTHING YOU HAD.”In the climax, a character acknowledges their worth even amidst despair: I RESPECT WHAT YOU DID FOR US... YOU ARE... MY SAVIOR. The chapter ends on a poignant note, emphasizing the fight for righteousness and the struggle against one’s own failures. “PLEASE! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME HERE!” is the last plea, leaving readers in suspense about the outcome."

Kiyoung exclaims, WILL YOU JOIN ME IN CREATING A BEAUTIFUL LINDELTOGETHER? eliciting enthusiasm from others who agree to fight against the evils of this world. They pledge to protect the weak, with Heeyoung expressing gratitude: I’M GLAD THERE’S SOMEONE OTHER THAN KIYOUNG-NIM WHO UNDERSTANDS Me.As they reflect on their achievements, they celebrate bringing a legendary priestess onto the team, though it comes with unexpected challenges. Despite the chaos, there’s hope as they see that “in the end, it all turned out great.”However, the chapter takes a darker turn as they face the consequences of their actions, filled with violent imagery and moral questioning. Characters are torn between their duties and the weight of taking lives, with one character exclaiming in desperation, “PLEASE SPARE U—THERE’S NO MERCY.” The priestess grapples with her identity after being thrust into a life of violence, saying, “I’M NO LONGER A PRIESTESS NOR A SAINT...BUT A MERE FALLEN LIVESTOCK SLAUGHTERER.”Amidst these tensions, there are lighter moments sprinkled throughout, hinting at a shared understanding and camaraderie among the group. Kiyoung reassures, I WILL Be TOGETHER WITH YOU THROUGH IT, showing loyalty and support.The mix of accountability and friendship poses a captivating conflict, leaving readers eagerly anticipating how the characters will navigate their paths forward while battling inner demons."

The guild members discuss their surprise at the newfound popularity of their party, comparing it to idol status back on Earth. Kiyoung expresses concern that Heera, a member from the Red Mercenaries, would react negatively if she finds out he's in danger. As the day progresses, they meet members of different guilds at a leaders' meeting. Kiyoung gets introduced to Choi Yunghi from the Red Mercenaries and finds that they have a past connection with Heera. Tensions rise as they face rival guilds vying for the same experience points. There’s also a confrontation with Petra, a calculative strategist, revealing Kiyoung's unease towards her tactics.Sun Heeyoung, a legendary priest, is introduced as a volunteer, creating a buzz and interest within the group. Kiyoung’s team sees her as an important addition to their ranks. They celebrate the formation of their dream team, recognizing the potential she brings.As the chapter closes, they discuss the upcoming raid at the Garden of Horror, expressing some rivalry and competition among guilds, particularly with the Black Swans. Kiyoung expresses his desire to raise levels rather than seek items or money, indicating a strategic focus on growth. However, there are underlying tensions as guild members hint at hidden intentions and feelings, especially regarding Kiyoung and his relationships with others."

Indicating that he's been misled, he clarifies that **CHA HEERA** isn’t the ally he thought. Amidst chaos, **KIYOUNG-SSI** checks on fellow party members, concerned for their well-being, proclaiming, ARE YOU HURT ANYWHERE?” **HYUNSUNG-SSI** interrupts to prevent a fateful confrontation, saying, YOU DON’T NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR ANYTHING regarding **KIYOUNG-SSI**’s concerns.As the party dynamics shift, **HYUNSUNG-SSI** defends his team's honor against front-line challenges and remarks, I SHOULDN’T HAVE HELD BACK, especially if they’re looking down on us. Meanwhile, **PETRA** provokes hostility within the guild, leading others to question her authority and friendships within the party.**YOUNGGI-SSI** urges a strategic withdrawal to avoid further conflicts, stating, LET'S TAKE A BREAK HERE... SET UP CAMP! Reflecting camaraderie, he shares a potion he's crafted to aid one of the guild members, leading to gratitude expressed by **KIYOUNG-SSI**, who appreciates the gesture, stating, YOU'RE A KIND-HEARTED PERSON.However, discord intensifies as **PETRA** sheds doubt on the motives driving the Blue Guild’s participation, harshly accusing them of ulterior motives, YOU'RE TRYING TO STEAL FROM NEWBIES! Confrontations escalate with **HYUNSUNG-SSI** challenging **PETRA**, revealing how poorly the Black Swan Guild is viewed and suggesting, THEY COULDN’T BEAR WATCHING YOU TAINT THE NAME OF THEIR GUILD ANY FURTHER.Ultimately, **PETRA** and **HYUNSUNG-SSI** find themselves caught in a spiral of accusations and alliances, teasing future conflicts, as **HYUNSUNG-SSI** boldly states, WE'LL KEEP ON MOVING FORWARD!

J Scarpati expresses their belief in the team's potential, saying, “I really think you guys are the hopes of the future of the Blue Guild,” but then transitions to expressing concern for Hyunsung’s decision-making. A member admonishes him, saying, “Why did you run out of formation like that without telling us? Seriously, we really panicked.” Hyunsung acknowledges his mistake, saying, “I apologize for not telling you in advance, but I don’t think it was a lot to handle on the rear.” Despite this, tensions escalate, and accusations fly, particularly aimed at Kiyoung, as someone exclaims, “Kiyoung was the problem... important to note.”As the party becomes increasingly aware of their shortcomings, Kiyoung declares, “I don’t think I can bear causing trouble to everyone anymore,” suggesting they should leave. But Younggi argues, “The Blue Guild shouldn’t be the one leaving.” This confrontation culminates in a shocking request from Younggi to Petra: “I would like to ask you to leave this expedition party.”Petra reacts passionately, feeling betrayed, “Did you really just say that? Are you really asking me to leave?” The situation rapidly deteriorates, leading to strong confrontations between the guild members and Black Swan.Despite the conflict, the group attempts to rally together when they face a monster attack. Hyunsung steps up as a leader, impressing others with the way he handles the chaos, showing growth despite being regarded as a “newbie.” In the end, as they deal with the monster threat, lines like “You were probably trying to stress the fact that there was a newbie party” and “We’re not just your average newbie party” highlight the newfound confidence of Hyunsung and his guild, culminating in a battle that tests their mettle and teamwork.By the chapter's close, the team reflects on their progress, with a member acknowledging, “You really were a sword genius!” revealing growth within the party despite their previous conflicts. The expedition ends on a note of unity, even with lingering tensions."

You really were after my body,” one character accuses, eliciting a mix of frustration and jealousy. Another responds, “How could I not be frustrated? You wanted others instead of me.” The tension escalates as they grapple with their feelings and past misunderstandings.As conversations shift to the power struggles within their guild, one character reflects on a coup d'état initiated against a corrupt guild master. “I came to Black Swan after the tutorial, but it was such a mess,” they lament. A push to ally with the Blue Guild is suggested, portraying the Black Swan as an oppressive force corrupting the continent.One character, asserting their worth, declares, “You’ll have to choose someone who is able to put you, a timid and greedy lump of ambition, on the safest throne. And that someone is me.” When they confront each other, allegations fly. “You used me as a tool to take care of her easily,” one reveals, highlighting betrayal and manipulative tactics amidst their struggles for power. The chapter concludes with a cautious negotiation of alliance: “Is that enough to show my apologies?” The overarching themes of ambition, betrayal, and emotional conflict come to a head, leaving the characters to ponder their true allegiances and the cost of their aspirations."

It opens with a character reflecting on their life's changes, realizing that they have escaped a violent past and corrected many mistakes, particularly by eliminating the vice guild master, Jung Jinho. This character expresses gratitude for the positive transformations in their life, especially regarding Hayan and Yeri coming under their protection sooner than anticipated.As the chapter progresses, we see tensions rise with the appearance of a character named Lee Kiyoung, whose affection for Hayan causes stirrings among others, leading to a conversation about public displays of affection. This light moment contrasts sharply with the darker narrative unfolding with the black magician, who speaks callously about past betrayals and the death of loved ones.The dialogue turns heated as the guild master confronts the black magician, questioning his morality and sincerity. The villain taunts the guild master by revealing that he must choose between saving his closest ally or letting others perish. This manipulation creates a crucial dilemma, with the guild master feeling the weight of his decisions, demonstrating the struggle between his ideals of justice and the harsh reality he faces.In a frantic moment, the guild master is urged by his allies to find a way to save everyone, but he's confronted with a grim ultimatum: kill his trusted ally to save another. The emotional stakes heighten, leading to a climactic moment where sacrifice and loyalty are tested.This chapter encapsulates the conflict between personal attachment and duty, setting the stage for dramatic choices that will have significant consequences for all involved."

He expresses unwavering determination to help others, and despite some frustration from his companions, they recognize his charismatic leadership. Lee Sanghee reveals thoughts about undertaking an exploration for the guild’s advancement but stresses the possible danger due to a cursed dungeon. The urgency escalates as they learn that the guild master is trapped in this cursed temple, prompting a call for a rescue team. Concerns arise about the safety and capabilities of the guild members left behind, especially with the suggestion of bringing in the inexperienced newcomers. During a tense discussion, Lee Seolho and others debate the importance of immediate action versus safeguarding the guild. The atmosphere oscillates between the impulsive eagerness of the newcomers and the cautious advice from experienced members. As the urgency to rescue their guild master intensifies, they must reconcile their fear of the dungeon’s dangers with the desperate need to act swiftly, paving the way for potential conflicts and character growth as they prepare for the next chapter of their adventure."

Hye-young accuses someone of being a murderer, while that person defends their actions as a rational choice for survival. You think you can get away from guilt by doing that? How petty, Hye-young-ssi, the murderer retorts, justifying their actions as instinctual. Frustrated, Hye-young states, You always protect yourself with that kind of thinking. I understand that you didn’t care about their lives in the process. The murderer dismisses her anger, asserting that in the end, they are alive while others are not, and they would make the same choices again regardless of the consequences.As the tension rises, the scene shifts to a character named Kiyoung, who calms Hye-young, attempting to restore her mana after a frightening ordeal. Dramatic emotions surge as accusations of being selfish and pitiful are thrown about, and the characters grapple with feelings of guilt and duty.Meanwhile, another group prepares for an expedition, revealing the presence of undead monsters and a darker element looming over them. They express regret over potential dangers faced, while a new character, a sorcery scholar named Jung-yeon, joins their ranks, further complicating the mission dynamics.An ominous energy fills the air, provoking fear and uncertainty, as everyone braces for battle against the impending doom. The chapter ends with an unsettling feeling of psychological trauma lingering among the characters, as they continue to confront their past decisions and the haunting consequences of their actions."

Jungkook is trapped in a mind-bending confrontation, pleading with his oppa, WAIT A SECOND! I can’t believe Jung Hayan used magic on my body! He realizes that Hayan's strange magic, which he initially deemed protective, has become a source of paranoia. Jungkook urgently declares, “I HAVE TO PREVENT THE WORST ENDING SOMEHOW!!”Amidst confusion and urgency, he shouts, “Kiyoung, WHERE ARE YOU??” and expresses the need to escape a dungeon and save others. He feels the gravity of the situation: “WE HAVE TO LEAVE QUICKLY,” as time grows short.Jung Hayan, in her twisted resolve, exclaims, “I’ll kill them all... EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!” revealing her dark intentions while also indicating her overwhelming desire to be with Jungkook. Meanwhile, they confront the formidable presence of Jultana, the owner of the dungeon, who complicates their mission. Jungkook realizes, “SHE’S NOT AN OPPONENT I CAN DEFEAT USING A BASIC CLASS. We’re here to rescue the survivors!”Desperation reigns; he shouts for his teammates and calls out “I NEED TO GIVE HER THE ANTIDOTE!” Hayan's warped love manifests as she declares, “I'M HERE TO MASSACRE THE HUMAN RACE!” showcasing her fractured state of mind.Ultimately, as they struggle with survival against both the external threats and their internal demons, Jungkook reinforces that “YOUR LIVES ARE OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY!” igniting a glimmer of hope in a dark situation. The chapter ends on a cliffhanger, leaving readers anxious about the fate of Jungkook, Hayan, Kiyoung, and their desperate quest for freedom and redemption."

Kiyoung expresses frustration, remarking on the impolite behavior of another character, who seems to be confidently dismissive about the situation. Hyunsung attempts to regain control as chaos ensues, with a voice of reason trying to calm the group down, insisting the blade isn't going berserk.Amidst the frantic atmosphere, Cedrick's mysterious connection to Juliana comes to light, revealing deeper emotional ties. Juliana's hesitation about their relationship is palpable as she considers the possibility of divorce, leading to an emotional confrontation. Geprick interjects, expressing his distress over what seems to be a self-destructive path, resulting in heated exchanges filled with concern and love.As the atmosphere becomes more charged, a sense of destiny emerges regarding the legendary weapon. Characters grappling with their feelings simultaneously acknowledge the weapon's significance, particularly Hyunsung, who is recognized for his combat skill. The chapter culminates with the invocation of a ritual that determines ownership of the legendary sword, setting the stage for Hyunsung to possibly claim its power.The chapter blends themes of love, confrontation, and destiny, leaving the characters at a critical juncture as they navigate their intertwined fates with the legendary weapon."

Kiyoung suggests fabricating stories since evidence doesn’t support Lee Seolho’s involvement in the death, which implies an ulterior motive. Deokgoo and Hayan are distraught about the guildmaster's passing, mourning their loss.The narrative unfolds as Kiyoung reveals suspicions about Lee Seolho and the chaotic situation in the Blue Guild. The conversation shifts to potential threats from rival guilds, highlighting the precarious state they're in. Kiyoung's confidence in deciphering the true events surrounding the guildmaster’s death leads to a confrontation—accusations fly regarding possible sabotage and the failure to secure reinforcements.As emotions peak, arguments break out over blame; Kiyoung stands firm, challenging others’ accountability, which only escalates tensions. The dialogue reflects grief, anger, and suspicion, painting a vivid picture of the guild's internal strife while also hinting at Kiyoung’s determination to confront the underlying issues and seek truth amidst the chaos. The chapter closes with a mix of rising discord and unresolved questions, setting the stage for future conflicts as alliances begin to fracture over differing perspectives on loyalty and betrayal."

Kiyoung accuses Seolho of being a disgusting traitor and expresses her deep desire for revenge, proclaiming that she will ensure he suffers for his actions. During the exchange, Seolho pleads for his life, offering to provide information about the Yamato Guild, revealing his desperation as he tries to escape the consequences of his betrayal.Amidst their chaotic arguments, the revelation that Seolho was in contact with the Yamato Guild sends shockwaves through the group. Accusations fly as Kiyoung and others confront Seolho with evidence of his betrayal, questioning his loyalty and motives. Seolho insists that all his actions were to save the Blue Guild from collapse, but Kiyoung and the others see through his lies, determining he must be punished for his treachery.As tensions rise, and the threat of punishment looms over Seolho, the characters reflect on their past bonds and trust. Lee Sanghee grapples with the realization that the allegiance they once shared is shattered, leading to an irreversible rift. The chapter concludes with Sanghee making a decisive move to imprison those associated with Seolho, marking the end of their brotherhood and establishing a new, more ruthless order within the Blue Guild."

You disgusting traitor! exclaims someone, pointing fingers at Seolho who is trapped in a mercenary's torturous scheme. A disdained member threatens, I wanted to end your life myself! and questions why only they are facing punishment.Seolho, realizing the gravity of what he faces, returns fire, It's too late for that! revealing he shows no mercy to enemies. He gears up for vengeance, fueled by the potential loss of a precious companion, stating, I'll make sure to remember every little bit of it... I will devote this painful death of yours to my precious person.As Seolho's fate hangs in the balance, desperate pleas for mercy arise. If you let me live, I’ll give you information! he offers, hoping to gain favor and save himself. What a wise decision from her Highness Lee Sanghee! someone notes amidst the chaos.However, it's revealed that betrayal runs deep within the guild. Seolho admits to being in contact with the Yamato Guild for the guild's future. It was all for the future of our guild! he claims, but another counters, That's what we call betrayal.Amidst their accusations, evidence is produced against Seolho regarding the guildmaster's death, leading to a fierce debate about trust and loyalty. Just what nonsense are you spouting? he retorts, but the evidence seems irrefutable.The chapter concludes with Sanghee declaring, You are no longer part of Blue, as chaos erupts, driving the group closer to a precipice of destruction. There will be no mercy! she commands, initiating a dark turn in their fates as alliances crumble."

We will start afresh and discard all old traditions.”As the tension escalates, he envisions a bright future, shouting, “Let the entire world know of Blue! This shall be the start of your era of success.” Meanwhile, his companions support his resurgence, hoping to revive the guild and unite everyone back at their headquarters, despite the protagonist’s impatience for immediate action.Later, the protagonist makes a bold announcement, acknowledging the past struggles of the Blue Guild and embracing the responsibility as the new guildmaster. “I’m honored to take up this role that I’m unworthy of,” he states, revealing plans for significant changes and introducing key positions within the guild.Amidst laughter and camaraderie, the characters reminisce about their doubts and rekindle their ambitions. As Lee Kiyoung is appointed to various high-ranking positions, he playfully protests, “Stop it already, you fucker… I’ll be in your care from now on.” The chapter closes with a sense of hope and renewed energy as they prepare to embark on this new chapter together."

Heera, a member of the Blue Guild, expresses her desire to bring her cute darling, Kiyoung, to the event for a well-deserved break from their demanding guild responsibilities.As the conversation unfolds, Kiyoung humorously seeks rescue from his heavy workload, while Heera's friends argue about his ability to handle their guild's affairs in his absence. Meanwhile, guests at the gathering, including Victor Hart, the escort for the event, introduce themselves, adding layers to their social dynamics.Amidst introductions, Kiyoung learns about a potential ambush from the Yamato Guild, with tensions rising between Heera and Kim Hyunsung, who argue over the safety of Kiyoung at the gathering. Heera insists on attending the luxurious party, despite Kiyoung's reluctance and unfinished work. The chapter sets up a mix of light-hearted banter and brewing conflicts, hinting at the challenges and alliances that will unfold at the gathering."

The dialogue kicks off with concerns for Rue’s well-being as she regains consciousness. A mysterious character reassures her, mentioning a shared vision of the future between them: “I saw the future... I will explain the details in time.” However, Rue is skeptical, Bullshit. Future, my ass. Tensions rise as Rue confronts this character, accusing him of being the same as before, despite his attempts to project warmth and happiness from their past. He reminisces, cheekily likening their relationship to that of a stray cat and its owner. As they delve into their past lives, Rue grapples with feelings of betrayal, reflecting, Did you think that I'd forget? The chapter continues with an ethereal tone as the characters explore their second chance at love, discussing the impact of their previous life choices. Rue expresses doubts: We’re not the same people we were in the first life, and questions whether true reconciliation is possible. Yet, the other character pledges his devotion, saying, “If that’s truly what you wish for, I shall gladly devote my blood and flesh in full to you.”Amidst their emotional exchanges, another character, a shaman, tries to connect with Rue, revealing a deeper understanding of their past: “You must be surprised. It can also be referred to as the past life, or a world of pitch black illusions.” Tension mounts as a potential trap is alluded to, suggesting hidden dangers in their new reality.Finally, the chapter shifts to intrigue as characters discuss the shaman’s unusual powers, hinting at deeper mysteries connected to their shared histories and inner turmoil: I am the one who possesses the eye that sees through the truth, past, and future. Rue's past life seems to haunt her presence, raising questions about identity, loyalty, and the intricate web of past relationships."

I could lose my life if I’m not careful...Kiyoung expresses his frustration at being targeted, while a mysterious character offers their blood for a pact, revealing their intent to serve him loyally. **Mysterious Character:** I will devote my everything to you, no one will come between us.  **Kiyoung:** Please don’t call me master in public!As they delve deeper, accusations surface regarding the LinDel attack, casting suspicion and revealing tangled loyalties. **Accuser:** Who did you say was behind the attack?  **Kiyoung:** Do you have proof? How dare you frame the innocent!  **Accuser (thinking):** “He’s not just angry at being framed; he’s trying to screw me over…”The chapter culminates with the realization that there’s a deeper plot afoot, and Kiyoung’s sword, a self-defending weapon, hints at more trouble to come. **Kiyoung:** A sword that moves on its own to protect its master...

Amid rumors of murder accusations, some characters express disbelief, fondly supporting Kiyoung despite the claims against him. There’s tension as Kiyoung must navigate public opinion and the implications for his future, particularly with an impending gathering.Heera, Kiyoung’s ally, devises a plan to help him while also advocating for Kiyoung's protection, culminating in a tense standoff concerning a legendary weapon, Julianna. The conversation shifts to the need to present Kiyoung as a victim to win public favor. Progress is made when Kiyoung gains protection from a powerful warrior, Victor Hart, boosting his standing. The chapter closes with preparations for the gathering, setting the stage for Kiyoung's next moves against the backdrop of political intrigue and personal challenges, all while maintaining a light-hearted banter with allies about their roles in this chaotic scenario."

The dialogue reveals a heated exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the nature of the Hallucination Potion. A witness insinuates that Kiyoung’s potion, supposedly a medicine, holds dangerously high levels of hallucinogenic ingredients, far exceeding those found in illegal drugs. The plaintiff alleges that Kiyoung has an accomplice, Kasugano Yuuno, and accuses them of collaborating in drug distribution. Yuuno, however, dismisses the claims, insisting she had not been involved due to illness. The prosecutor then links Kiyoung to a string of criminal activities, stating that the Blue Guild's rise was fueled by illegal drug sales, leading to serious crimes like murders and attacks. Kiyoung responds by asserting these charges are fabricated to cover up the wrongdoings of others.As the courtroom erupts with argument, Kiyoung's claims of innocence are challenged with evidence from a journal suggesting he created the potion in question. Despite the pressure, Kiyoung maintains that the Hallucination Potion is medicinal and not illegal, stirring chaos among the spectators.The chapter concludes with Kiyoung’s arrest on charges of heresy amidst allegations of a larger conspiracy involving powerful figures, including claims of his connection to dark forces within the Holy Empire. The tension mounts, leaving readers curious about the outcome of this explosive courtroom battle."

A character reveals, The identity of the hallucination potion is…, sparking chaos in the courtroom. He accuses others, asserting, You received a report that it was an illegal drug... The subordinate who informed you was a spy from the Black Swan Guild. The weight of betrayal hangs heavy as accusations fly, with an exclamation of, You are the real heretics!Frustration mounts when the protagonist declares, Now that I think about it... I guess that's true. A heated debate ensues about the use of holy water turned illegal drugs, with one character vehemently insisting, You must not be deceived! Cardinal Bazel’s allegiance is questioned as it becomes clear that he believes he has seen a vision of righteousness, leading to a devastating verdict: Hurry up and execute him immediately!As tensions rise, alliances shift drastically, with characters urging, Let’s work together to cleanse him of the Devil’s power! The atmosphere in the courtroom becomes charged with chaos as responses grow frantic: You vile devil worshiper! and This is all because of you! I'll kill you!The chapter culminates in a fierce debate over the nature of heresy and manipulation of perception, with characters daring, You think you're fine after tormenting someone noble? The protagonist’s calls for an investigation culminate in distrust towards the Holy Council, revealing their dark secrets. A final appeal for the truth resonates: Why don’t we try it out? as they grapple with the consequences of their beliefs. The chapter closes with intrigue surrounding a trial involving a summoned monster, promising a climax that questions the very foundation of their convictions."

The main character expresses joy and surprise over the gifts they brought back, including a black griffin for their friend. However, tension arises when the protagonist discovers a new chief secretary has joined the guild, creating feelings of jealousy.Why did you bring back so many presents for us?” one guild member asks. The protagonist explains, “Think of this as spoils of war.” As they interact, another character, Hyunsung, introduces his new secretary, Cho Hyejin, much to the protagonist's chagrin. They can't help but feel threatened by Hyejin's sudden arrival and the bond she's forming with Hyunsung. I guess I'm just a side hoe now, huh? the protagonist thinks, grappling with feelings of being overshadowed. Acknowledging her talent, the guild members sing her praises, causing the protagonist to further question their worth in the guild. The chapter shifts to a more serious tone when the protagonist is pulled into a battle against a formidable foe, Ito Souta, a devil-worshiper. As chaos ensues, the protagonist confronts Ito, expressing disbelief at his betrayal. You made this entire thing up!!! they cry in frustration. The stakes rise as the protagonist knows they must act to eliminate the threat, feeling cornered by circumstance.The confrontation culminates in a fierce showdown, and the protagonist channels divine power in an attempt to purify Ito's soul. “Please, don’t make the wrong choices in your next life,” they implore. Ultimately, Ito’s fate is sealed, with the protagonist forgoing personal feelings for survival, illustrating the ongoing struggle between personal loyalty and the greater good within their guild. The chapter closes with a stark reminder of the protagonist's position: If I let him live, he'll definitely get in my way eventually."

He recalls a letter from **Marlin** regarding **Cho Hyeujin's** background check and the complexities surrounding her past, highlighting that sometimes being too righteous can backfire. As preparations for an expedition unfold, the team exchanges presents, showcasing camaraderie with **Deokgoo** receiving a shield and a sword, while **Jungyeon** gets new glasses that enhance her view of Deokgoo’s muscles.Tensions arise when **Hyunsung** recruits **Hyejin** without consulting Kiyoung first, leading to a misunderstanding about Kiyoung's feelings toward the decision. Kiyoung, feeling slighted, disguises his discomfort but reassures Hyunsung that he is fine with the changes. Eventually, Hyunsung apologizes for assuming Kiyoung’s feelings and expresses his desire to see capable individuals work together for the guild’s benefit.Amidst the banter and misunderstandings, Kiyoung and Hyunsung come to an understanding, reinforcing their trust in each other. Kiyoung's appreciation for Hyunsung's thoughtfulness surfaces, and together they prepare for the challenges ahead, focusing on the guild's mission and the threats looming over **Kesslock**, where recent monster invasions demand their attention. The chapter dives into themes of trust, miscommunication, and collaboration while maintaining a lighthearted tone amid the tensions."

Kurose Touma nervously introduces the idea of diving into a black market business venture, leading to a humorous exchange as Kiyoung dismisses the idea and misinterprets Touma's motives. Don't act dumb! he retorts, while Touma insists he's not looking for revenge against Song Jeongwook, despite the latter's overwhelming hostility towards him.As the dialogue unfolds, Lady Marlin Kesslock makes a spirited appearance, revealing her infatuation with Kiyoung, much to his embarrassment. Meanwhile, tensions rise between Kiyoung and Jeongwook, who is revealed to be the guildmaster responsible for Hyejin's downfall. Hyejin's quest for vengeance against Jeongwook drives the narrative, as Kiyoung contemplates how to navigate the complex dynamics of the Kesslock power struggle.Kiyoung's reputation as a talented alchemist comes into play as he faces skepticism about his dealings and abilities from Jeongwook, who sees him as inferior. Jeongwook's condescending attitude only serves to fuel Kiyoung's determination to prove his worth in the face of adversity, saying, Alchemists are alchemists because they hit the jackpot with their alchemy skills.The chapter ends with Kiyoung cornered into an agreement, feeling as though he has no choice but to stamp his thumb on a contract that could change everything, highlighting his reluctance yet resolve to engage in the tumultuous world around him."

Xiaolin introduces himself, emphasizing his importance but expressing discomfort with being too friendly with Alisa, hinting at a complex social dynamic. Alisa’s skepticism shines through as she questions the dubious character of Song Jungwook, revealing the underlying moral conflicts they face.Cho Hyejin reflects on the repercussions of their whistleblowing against Jungwook, revealing the struggles of those affected by their actions, leading to accusations of hypocrisy. The dialogue oscillates between self-defense, emotional turmoil, and grudges, showcasing how past memories influence their current loyalties. Tensions escalate as Hyejin grapples with the guilt of not eliminating Jungwook despite the latter’s wrongdoings.As they explore the black market and confront uncomfortable truths, Hyejin's reluctance to follow through with drastic actions becomes a focal point, creating friction between her beliefs and the harsh realities faced by their former guild members. Meanwhile, a chaotic mix of flirtation and possessiveness emerges among supporting characters, leading to comical interactions and misunderstandings.Ultimately, this chapter dives deep into themes of guilt, loyalty, and the blurred lines between morality and personal history, setting a path for future confrontations and revelations."

A character reflects on their guilt for allowing Song Jungwook to survive, sharing, I let Song Jungwook stay alive... all this time. There’s a mention of bribery as a character manipulates the situation, stating, Thank God I bribed the driver... he's bound to die anyway. The narrative shifts to the secret garden of the Kesslock Lord's Palace, where an important meeting takes place. Lady Marlin is summoned unexpectedly, and there is a manipulation at play, as one character suggests, Play along. There’s a morally complex discussion about purchasing slaves while grappling with the ethics of their captivity, They’re people just like us... why? Does that make you feel sad? Amidst their plans, one character reveals ambitions to eliminate the chaos of the black market, stating, I will take control of the evil in society, aiming to create an uncorrupted auction market. They conclude that Song Jungwook... is an obstacle, indicating a looming confrontation between the two. As tensions heighten, suspicion arises over their current situation, hinting that they may be in danger: They’re probably trying to dispose of us. This chapter closes with a sense of foreboding and urgency, ending with the realization that they must be vigilant about their safety: Should probably check on the elves first."

One character expresses regret for not recognizing Song Jungwook's potential sooner, declaring him a hero destined to lead Kesslock into a bright future. Song Jungwook, although hesitant, is encouraged to take on the challenge of leading the Little Rock Guild to victory alongside Cha Heera. As preparations ramp up, the urgency escalates with news of a monster wave and dragon footprints threatening the city. The Lord of Kesslock decides to declare martial law and appoints Lee Kiyoung as the commander, a position he seems unprepared for yet eager to embrace. There is a push to ensure the safety of the guild and a strategy is formed to place them on the front lines, despite initial concerns over their safety. Unbeknownst to them, Lee Kiyoung's decision to position them at the forefront is a calculated risk, aimed at ensuring they do not fade into obscurity. Dialogue emphasizes the tension of leadership, responsibility, and the desire for glory, as Jungwook grapples with the weight of expectations and the imminent battle ahead."

Then you should have been nice from the beginning. He accuses Kiyoung of being a dirty, disgusting individual and blames his downfall on poor relationships. Kiyoung retorts with anger, declaring he won’t die there, implying his determination to fight back.As tensions rise, Kiyoung learns of a retreat order given by the Vice Guildmaster, leading him to question his allies. Jungwook seizes the moment to reveal knowledge of an assassination attempt against the Vice Guildmaster, accusing Kiyoung directly and highlighting Kiyoung's involvement in an elf slave market. Despite Kiyoung's attempts to deny responsibility, Jungwook insists, I’ll still kill useless trash like this.When Kiyoung tries to grasp the situation, he hears a familiar voice: Lee Kiyoung. They engage in a battle of wits, with Jungwook claiming that Kiyoung plotted against both him and Cho Hyewjin. As the realization strikes Kiyoung, he expresses his desperation, begging Jungwook for mercy and offering his black market connections in exchange for his life.However, Jungwook remains steadfast, ready to deliver justice to uphold the peace of Kesslock. With chaos brewing, Jungwook reveals he’s orchestrated the soldiers’ positioning to expose Kiyoung's true nature. The chapter ends on a cliffhanger, with impending danger from monsters rushing in, leaving Kiyoung cornered and desperate.Overall, this chapter showcases a confrontation filled with deception, betrayal, and the urgency of moral justice amidst the backdrop of a brewing storm."

A character relays urgent news to the commander about a dragon, and recalls a conversation mentioning that Song Jungwook may have stolen a dragon egg. Commanders! There's a big problem! Dragow's coming with a bunch of monsters! one character warns, while another reflects on their instincts that led them to suspect Song Jungwook's involvement with the black market's dragon egg. As the chaos unfolds at the castle walls with relentless attacks, they strategize to protect their home and uphold the honor of General Song. Let’s protect Kesslock and our homes! For General Song Tungwook! they rally the troops, fueled by revenge yet conflicted over the morality of their means.An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth, one character cynically notes, justifying the violent methods they resort to in the name of peace. Amidst all this battle, alliances shift, and Cho Hyejin becomes a pivotal figure to the protagonist as they navigate the aftermath of Jungwook's demise and the consequences of their choices. As the dust settles, questions arise about the nature of the dragon eggs seen on the black market, leaving readers on the edge of their seats for what’s to come next."

One character expresses their determination, insisting, We can just get rid of them one by one. However, another is plagued by guilt about not being able to save a dragon egg, repeatedly lamenting, Cannot disappoint Offa. The urgency of the mission escalates when they realize they may have lost the egg due to a sudden fall. The character expresses their frustration, Dammit... I was definitely holding it, and fears it might have been harmed. Their companion, Jung Hayan, tries to comfort them, saying, Don't worry about it. Just save your mana. But the disappointment in themselves weighs heavily as they acknowledge the importance of the egg.As the fight against the mother dragon intensifies, one character resolves to take advantage of the distraction the soldiers are providing: I’ll use this opportunity to take the egg. They all urge each other to keep fighting despite the setbacks, grappling with their feelings of worthlessness and regret, especially the sentiment, I'm useless being echoed among them throughout the chaos. Ultimately, the chapter captures a blend of action and emotional turmoil as the characters navigate their responsibilities and the weight of their failures while battling formidable foes."

Are you sure you're not trying to kill me?! she exclaims, seeking assurance from others. Hyunsung reassures her that the other guild members will soon return with Hyejin, prompting them to prepare for what lies ahead. Kiyoung suggests finding safety nearby and reveals that they might be able to get help.Suddenly, unexpected reunion with a masked man occurs, who playfully comments on the situation and his admiration for Noona. Conflict escalates when a character known as Madman sacrifices his intelligence to boost his attack power in a fit of rage. Amidst the chaos, the real concern becomes avoiding harm, with characters urging each other to stay back and remain safe.Kiyoung manages to reassure Noona by showing she’s unscathed, while acknowledging that Cha Heera has become dangerously calm but ready to attack. Discussions between Kiyoung and another ally reveal the understanding of Cha Heera’s terrifying trait, heightening the tension as she seeks to unleash chaos. The chapter closes with the guild members strategizing their next steps against the looming threat, encouraging each other to stay strong amidst the turmoil."

']]","In this chapter of Regressor Instruction Manual, tensions rise as the characters deal with the repercussions of the dragon egg's mysterious status. Hayang expresses her guilt and jealousy over the egg, confessing, I understand that the dragon egg was a very important thing to you... This leads to her admitting that she put a location tracker on it, intending to get rid of it later because she felt overwhelmed. As the scene shifts, Hyunsung's anxiety intensifies when he encounters a masked man from his past, sparking suspicion about their connection. Long time no see, masked man, he acknowledges awkwardly, grappling with the idea that their prior meeting at a masquerade ball might have implications he wasn't ready for.Meanwhile, Xiao Lin intervenes with a proposition to handle a strong enemy, suggesting, “You want me to fight that gorilla, right?” Her willingness to assist shows her unexpected depth, although Hyunsung internally debates her character, worried about her being involved with the enemy nation.The chapter culminates in a sense of urgency as they debate the whereabouts of the dragon egg amidst the ensuing chaos. The characters realize the potential danger of the egg being in the wrong hands, leading to a racing thought: “The monsters have also calmed down, and the castle's defense is fine without us.” Suspense hangs in the air, as they speculate whether the monsters' behavior is linked to the search for the lost dragon egg.Overall, this chapter highlights the complex interpersonal dynamics among the characters while building up the stakes surrounding the lost dragon egg."

Kiyoung begins by acknowledging Dialugia’s plight, realizing she invaded Kesslock out of desperation for her child. Despite the chaos her actions caused, he expresses a willingness to protect her child, saying, Please, don't worry. I plan to carry out my duties... but on one condition... can you provide me your body? This odd request reveals his intent to collaborate on his alchemy research.Dialugia’s mistrust of Kiyoung arises, as she can’t comprehend how she could accept partnership with someone who uses children as leverage. Kiyoung reassures her, I’m an alchemist. Plus, this series is for all ages. Through their dialogue, Kiyoung introduces himself as the Vice Guildmaster, hoping to ease her anxiety about their situation.As they navigate their relationship, Kiyoung is tasked with a broader conflict involving monsters threatening Kesslock, which leads to an intense battle where Kiyoung tries to show his leadership and heroism. Amidst the turmoil, he can't help but think of the dragon egg and its significance, realizing it could bond him with Dialugia and her offspring.Eventually, Kiyoung reflects on the child’s reactions, joking, “It might be because I was the first one it saw...” suggesting a potential trust or connection forming. However, the chapter takes a dramatic turn when Kiyoung and his troops face off against other monsters, with many wanting to destroy Dialugia for her valuable dragon leather. Kiyoung intervenes, revealing his protective instincts, stating emphatically, “Please...!!! That's...! A dragon from just now?!”As misunderstandings unfold among the human commanders concerning whether to capture or kill Dialugia, Kiyoung defends her, citing the child and emphasizing, “I’ll die too if she dies.” Amidst the turmoil, he reflects on how their fates are intertwined, coming to terms with the weight of his responsibilities both as a husband in an unexpected marriage and as a protector of the dragon’s family.The chapter ends with Kiyoung’s determination to safeguard the child and the intricate dynamics that emerge between him, Dialugia, and their fated roles within the escalating conflict."

One character feels inadequate, questioning their own strength while someone else encourages them, asserting that they wouldn't have survived if they had been serious about their training. Amidst chatter about their paths and aspirations, the guild members celebrate their achievements, with significant news shared: two members have been selected as part of the newly established Eight Seats of the Empire.Kiyoung, one of the chosen, is acknowledged for becoming the first human selected by a dragon. The camaraderie among the guild is evident as they warm up to the idea of celebrating their new status, despite underlying tensions as some feel envious or left behind. The discussions about their roles and recognition indicate a shift in power dynamics within their realm, subtly hinting at underlying conflicts and future challenges. As they gather for a celebratory dinner, the mood lightens, but some characters, like Park Deokgoo, express anxiety about their status.

Kiyoung and his companions are preparing for the Imperial Reception, but Kiyoung's hesitation around networking is evident. You can leave it to me, Kiyoung insists, wanting to avoid the uncomfortable social interactions.Meanwhile, there are underlying tensions and doubts surrounding trust within their group. Does he still think I'm a spy of the enemy? Kiyoung wonders, reflecting on his past contact with Xiao Lin. As they prepare for the event, there's concern for another member, Deokgoo, whose capacity to contribute to the team is under scrutiny. At this rate, he would only be a burden to the party, one character states, highlighting the pressure they feel to perform.Kiyoung reassures his friends while managing their anxieties, emphasizing self-reliance and resilience: If I can do it, you can do even better. This mantra serves as motivation but also reveals the challenge of maintaining morale in high-stress situations.The chapter takes a lighter tone when Kiyoung interacts with Dialuria, using playful banter to underscore the deep bonds despite the serious undertones of their mission. As they navigate their duties, Cardinal Bazel introduces himself with a mix of humility and cunning, hinting at political alliances that could shape their future in the Empire. Kiyoung’s recognition of the political landscape against the pressure from both the Pope and the Emperor adds to the complexity of their situation. Ultimately, the chapter encapsulates themes of trust, resilience, and the intricate balance of personal and political agendas, as the characters prepare for a pivotal moment in their journey."

The chapter opens with a plea from one character, urging their hyung-nim (older brother) to promise never to join a dangerous group led by Jung Jinho. Please promise it. I can’t do bad things even if I want to because of you, you stupid pig. Despite their frustrations, the older brother insists he will support his companion and that he can achieve even greater heights, stating, If I can do it... then I can do even better!As the narrative unfolds, a diagnosis of their predicament reveals a miscalculation and betrayal, which sparks a desperate call for action: Plague! Catch those traitors! The older brother struggles with feelings of guilt about their current situation, voicing, “It’s not your fault. There was a misstep in the calculation.” Despite the escalating danger and the desire for the younger character to be left behind for his safety, a heartfelt exchange takes place. I’m not gonna do that no matter what you say, emphasizes the older brother’s commitment, further affirming their protective bond. The younger one, expressing gratitude, acknowledges, “Thank you for choosing me and for defending me even when I made mistakes.”The humor in their interactions shines through as they banter about their battle tactics and training methods, but there's a serious undercurrent. The pressure mounts as they discuss the need for growth and improvement, realizing the importance of loyalty and trust built over time. The older brother contemplates, “Loyalty and trust like his that have been built from the start are hard to obtain.”The chapter concludes with the characters' renewed determination to progress and a hint of intrigue as they navigate their complex relationships and the dangers that lie ahead. There's a clear desire for a better future, with the younger character contemplating the risks involved in following the older brother, but ultimately accepting it as part of their shared journey. This is all so that we can get to a better position in life, sums up their motivation to keep pushing forward together despite the odds."

You knew that we couldn’t have a happy ending anyway, one questions, revealing the shaman's ability to see future pain. The other snaps back, blaming them for manipulating their destiny and calling them a poison instead of the medicine they once believed. A sense of bitterness lingers as past traumas and guilt emerge; one character recalls a future where a friend dies prematurely, stressing the importance of helping him grow stronger to avoid that fate. Why is everyone around me so annoying? one bemoans, highlighting their struggle with relationships and self-worth.As tensions escalate, they grapple with conflicting emotions of reliance and rejection. Stay away from me. What are you? one demands, questioning the other's true motives. In a moment of vulnerability, the wounded character offers their arm for treatment, reflecting a deeper connection despite the pain.Ultimately, they realize they’ve shared more than they intended, acknowledging the complexities of love and revenge. Despite the darkness surrounding them, there's a glimmer of hope as one expresses, “Don’t leave me…” suggesting a deep-seated need for companionship amid turmoil. The chapter closes on this poignant note, leaving readers questioning the fine line between love, betrayal, and the desire for redemption."

Kiyoung, frustrated, exclaims, I just told you that we didn’t do whatever you think we did. This was just a kind of ritual. Hayan, panicking, insists she's fine while Yuuno questions, But you don’t look like you’ve been carrying out a ritual. Amidst the chaos, Hayan feels the pressure as Kiyoung urges her, “Do you want to end up in jail as a terrorist?” The atmosphere is thick with guilt and embarrassment, leading to accusations of rudeness and insincerity. As Kiyoung tells Yuuno, “I’m really disappointed in you, Jung Hayan,” Hayan's guilt escalates, making her almost cry, I feel so guilty! But I also don’t want to die!Yuuno and Hayan eventually reconcile when they discuss going on a date, suggesting that the tension is easing. Hayan shyly asks, Are you not mad at me anymore? to which Kiyoung reassures her, I wasn’t mad at you, but...” The chapter concludes with humor as Hayan reacts to Kiyoung's gift, prompting playful banter about spending money recklessly.Throughout the chapter, themes of misunderstanding, reconciliation, and the humorous dynamics of their relationships are examined as the characters navigate their tensions and emotions."

The chapter opens with a protagonist expressing determination, stating, “I won't let you die,” emphasizing their resolve to become stronger. A character mentions, “Training’s hard, right?” indicating a shared understanding of their rigorous commitment to improvement.One character suggests using a special serum to become stronger quickly, but another protests, “I don’t need it. I’ll become stronger in a flash if I drink this?” This sparks a debate over the value of shortcuts versus hard work, reinforcing the importance of genuine effort in their growth. A comical exchange follows about the fear of being inside a dragon, highlighting their unique circumstances as they venture into a dragon's body for research.Inside the dragon, one character notes, “It’s kind of similar to a human's insides but also so different,” showcasing the fascinating yet daunting aspects of their exploration. As they extract the dragon's blood, the dialogue turns humorous and chaotic, culminating in one character gleefully shouting, “I’m so much stronger now!” after their experimentation yields positive results.The excitement builds as they each achieve new powers, with one declaring, “I created the same thing in my own... while you were experimenting!” This leads to a competitive spirit as they both desire unique and special abilities. The chapter closes with a discussion about their next challenge involving a guild known as the Red Mercenaries, indicating that their adventures are far from over, and their united goal remains to grow stronger and capture formidable foes.Thus, the chapter highlights themes of ambition, teamwork, and the pursuit of strength, wrapped in a blend of humor and tension as the characters navigate their extraordinary world."

One character apologizes for an earlier mishap in a training scenario, leading to an exploration of strength and the importance of challenging oneself. The conversation shifts to rumors and relationships within their guild, highlighting a potential romantic interest involving Hyunsung and the guild master, Park Yeonjoo. It seems Hyunsung has been rejecting advances, which prompts a discussion on how to facilitate their connection. Amidst the humor and drama, there's also a touch of admiration and camaraderie within the group, as they prepare for a prank while hinting at their social dynamics, popularity, and perceived attractiveness.The chapter concludes with excitement over the prank, emphasizing their close-knit friendship and collaborative spirit as they look forward to their next adventure."

Deokgoo expresses a mix of excitement and apprehension, wondering if they might win against their presumed adversaries, while others seek reassurance that no one is actually hurt, suggesting it's all part of an act.As they delve into their pasts, they discuss experiences from Earth and the dangers of button-spamming in games, leading to unexpected digital encounters. Kiyoung, meanwhile, reflects on a sinister past involving the Murder Brigade, raising concerns about their potential resurgence. The atmosphere is tense as they prepare for confrontation but remain vigilant due to past threats.The chapter crescendos with the sudden appearance of a powerful figure from the opposing guild, leaving the group shocked.

It opens with a humorous note as one character (likely Hayan) contemplates an apology token from a mysterious figure, hinting at the intimidating presence of Kesslock. Days later, at the academy, Hayan reflects on the teaching experience, reminiscing about his past as a teacher on Earth. “It suits you,” a friend comments, suggesting he is finding joy in the role, which sparks delightful conversations about their lessons. As lunch unfolds, they discuss the students—who seem more engaged and eager than expected. Hayan mentions a particularly talented mage, intriguing his friends further. Meanwhile, they comment jokingly about their fellow instructor's unique attire, contributing to a light-hearted school spirit.Amidst the camaraderie, Hayan reveals his concerns about one of his students struggling with comprehension, but he reassures them that it’s okay, showcasing his supportive nature. Emotional moments arise when characters reflect on their growth, camaraderie, and the importance of sticking together, leading to heartfelt confessions among them.As the narrative progresses, political elements seep in when characters navigate city safety and guild relations, revealing the complexities of their world. Lee Jihye appears to grasp this opportunity for political maneuvering, garnering support among guilds for a unified front against threats.Finally, a significant setup occurs as characters plan for new recruit training at the academy, mentioning the importance of non-combat professionals and the urgent need for the industry to gain respect. The chapter culminates in a proposition for an instructor role that comes with perks, hinting at future developments in character dynamics and guild operations. Overall, the chapter encapsulates themes of mentorship, personal growth, and the intertwining of politics and training in their adventurous realm."

One character, feeling the need to fight back, reflects on a traumatic encounter with someone they describe as an insane psychopath. They reveal that a friend has lost her magic and express regret for past misunderstandings, highlighting the need to protect each other.Amidst this turmoil, the focus shifts to the day of the Red Mercenary demonstration event, where characters like Vakim Kichul are introduced. Despite his delinquent appearance, he is acknowledged for his skills. A conversation circles around the interest and trust in another, deepening the complexity of relationships amongst the characters. There's a mention of forming a guild, creating further concern about alliances.As the story develops, a character expresses admiration for another's magical abilities, leading to a promise of support in learning magic. Relationships strengthen, but underlying issues surface, particularly regarding one character's obsession with another's boyfriend. This obsession complicates dynamics, eliciting feelings of jealousy and a need for protection among friends.Despite the camaraderie, darker undertones emerge as one character vows revenge on an individual for perceived disrespect. The chapter closes with a sense of dread, as fears about safety and the consequences of obsession become apparent, culminating in a desperate plea for mercy from one character who ultimately fears for her life. This chapter now sets the stage for impending conflicts fueled by both magical and emotional stakes."

Hyunsung begins the dialogue, questioning Ahyoung about her connection with another character, hinting at jealousy and suspicion. You don’t have a class, and you’re not on the expedition team. You two must have gotten real close while I was busy, huh?” Ahyoung, feeling pressured, firmly responds, “Could you say something like that? I’ve been cheering you on this whole time.”Despite the mixed signals, another character urges Ahyoung to reject a prestigious offer, asserting, “Reject that offer. You’re not fit for somewhere that great. Come with me to Kesslock instead.” This raises stakes as she contemplates her next steps. Sensing the rising drama, the narrator reflects, “I never found out what actually happened,” implying unresolved narratives in the background, particularly regarding Kim Kichul’s character, whom others label as problematic due to his dubious skills. As the characters navigate their conflicting plans and emotions, a sparring match is initiated. “Do you want to... try fighting me?” The challenge is posed by Lee Kiyoung, initiating a tense training moment where strength and strategy are crucial.The narrative shifts to Kim Changryeol, who discusses his aspirations of joining the Blue Guild, despite his lack of stealth abilities, crucial for assassins. “He needs strong and talented individuals,” Kiyoung thinks, weighing Changryeol’s potential against his limitations. A further layer of intrigue surfaces as Kiyoung contemplates making a recruit for another guild.As secrets unravel, there's a twist involving Han Sora, whose reckless mishap leads to grave consequences, stirring chaos for her guild. “I heard that she was trying to steal something... became crippled because she touched some experimental equipment.” The aftermath of her actions prompts questions about the guild's future, as another character fears for their magical instruction, “Then who’s gonna teach us magic?”In the end, a hopeful note is struck with the good news of Ahyoung's scout offer, but the uncertainty looms, “I’m not sure why he chose me.” This encapsulates the chapter's theme of navigating personal relationships, ambitions, and the shadows of past decisions, leaving characters to grapple with their evolving dynamics as they move forward."

Hayan's change in class impresses everyone, and despite her troubled past, she seems more at peace lately. The guild is buzzing with excitement as they aim to create something amazing together.Meanwhile, a character named Kim Changryeol expresses his fondness for his personal battle slave, Yoo Ahyoung, highlighting her strength. Although he uses her for convenience in combat, others are suspicious of how he tames her. As discussions unfold, Changryeol’s jealousy surfaces regarding Kim Kichul, who appears to have an interest in Yoo.Tensions rise when past actions and manipulative tactics come to light, especially with Changryeol's controlling nature impacting his relationship with Yoo. A confrontation with Kichul leads to a test of strength and character, hinting at deeper conflicts brewing within the guild's dynamics.Lastly, an ominous negotiation emerges between Changryeol and Kichul, suggesting ulterior motives and the possibility of betrayal as they navigate their ambitions within the guild.

One character ominously warns, “If you reject us, tell people about the truman,” hinting at serious consequences. Despite some initial tension, it appears that Hyunsung doesn’t seem too troubled, and the group acknowledges the importance of luck in the dungeon, emphasizing the significance of their luck stats for success.Tony declares, “I’ll trust Kiyoung and go for it,” as they weigh the potential risks and rewards, revealing that survivors from another guild reported useful information about the dungeon. Kiyoung is urged to gather more data on guild members not on the luck list, stressing that luck’s correlation with personality and style could greatly influence their chances.As the team prepares for the raid, they acknowledge their training has been fruitful but remain cautious. “It’s still too early to let our guard down,” one warns, underscoring the unpredictability of their mission. The emerging challenges become clearer when they stumble upon “the dungeon guide” and react with urgency as the team discovers that a character, Dialuria, has gotten herself stuck while maturing rapidly, causing unexpected chaos.The chapter reaches a climax with Park Yeonjoo, the guildmaster from the Black Swan, addressing the dire situation they face with trapped individuals in the newly discovered dungeon rift. “There are many people trapped in there right now that are on the verge of dying,” she pleads, setting an urgent, high-stakes tone for their next actions. The tension builds as the risks of confronting various boss monsters are laid out—even the chance of facing one deemed a divine grade, prompting nervousness among the characters as they realize the gravity of their upcoming expedition."

WingwringY exclaims, If it's with my mind's eye and this party, we can win! However, there's tension as the group realizes that luck may not be on their side, with one member lamenting, “Why is it...that the situation...only seems to go favorably for him?”Lee Kiyoung reassures the party, asserting, “I have had the luck to survive even the toughest situations,” despite his worries about the daunting presence of divine beings in the museum. Suspicion looms over Hyungsung, who may be hiding something critical about his identity and the stakes of their mission, as another adds, “He might be the manager of the museum and the final boss.”As preparations for the raid unfold, Hayang is told, “You should prepare your magic,” highlighting the urgency of their situation. Notably, the power of the 'Mind's Eye' skill comes into focus, with characters reflecting on its advantages: “Since it lets me know how to deal with things that people wouldn't know from the start.” However, the challenge intensifies as they face summoned monsters with the risk of their health being drained if caught unprepared.Chaos ensues, and the team is reminded, “Even if the sky falls, there will be a way out,” setting the tone for the group's spirit as they brace for the unknown. The chapter is a blend of strategy, camaraderie, and the looming threat of what awaits in the museum's depths."

Hyunsung exclaims, “CAN’T YOU TELL? I’M PRAYING,” revealing his desperate attempts to stave off disaster. Meanwhile, a villain expresses a shocking reluctance to care about the continent’s fate, stating, “I DON'T CARE IF THE ENTIRE CONTINENT DIES. I JUST NEED TO SURVIVE WITH MY TREASURES.”The group grapples with fear as they ponder the potential devastation, with one of them suggesting it would be simple to sacrifice themselves to appease the god. “ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? DID YOU FORGET WHAT WE CAME HERE FOR?!!” is shouted in response, highlighting the stakes of their mission.As they strategize to prevent the summoning, they uncover potential probability manipulations—a discovery spotted by Hyunsung who urges, “THE VICE GUILDMASTER IS RIGHT.” Alarmed by their circumstances, there’s a collective push to act swiftly, knowing there are only seconds left before the sealer is undone. “SECONDS REMAINING UNTIL PARTIAL UNSEALING,” echoes the urgency in their dialogue.Amid plans that involve the use of powerful items, Hyunsung musters confidence, stating, “I TRUST YOU, KIYOUNG,” which instills a glimmer of hope in a dire situation. The weight of their choices hangs heavily as they navigate a course of action to avert the chaos of releasing the ancient god, illustrating the struggle between selfish desires and the fate of their world."

A heated argument ensues with one character angrily insisting, “THE DRAGONS HAVE PROTECTED THE PEACE OF THE CONTINENT FOR GENERATIONS” while another counters with concerns for their descendants. Emotions run high as they realize that ignoring the threat could leave future generations without parents. One character, Dialuria, is torn between her emotions and the harsh reality, expressing sorrow towards her ancestors and fear for the future. There’s a strong sense of urgency as they discuss the imminent danger from the Ancient God, with one character expressing frustration over the quietude of this entity, suggesting it might be gaining strength.As they prepare to face the threat head-on, there’s a moment of camaraderie as a character thanks another for their earlier reassurance. However, tensions rise when another member expresses an interest in looting a museum, and discussions about permission escalate into chaos. They stress the importance of addressing the danger and not simply looting for personal gain, indicating that their priorities must lie with the fate of their home.The chapter concludes with a dire acknowledgment that if the Ancient God is not dealt with soon, “THE CONTINENT WILL BE IN RUINS” in a matter of years, revealing the gravity of the situation and their determination to act swiftly."

He expresses concern for his friend Oolha, who seems to have been abandoned during a moment of vulnerability. Max admires Kiyoung for her strength, yet wonders why she knows his name. As discussions about the museum take place, it becomes clear that a scheme is afoot to control it, fueled by greed and power. There's an unsettling revelation about a bomb capable of destroying the museum and the continent. While one character seems eager for chaos, Max takes a stand to protect both the museum and the continent, showcasing his growth in responsibility.Throughout the chaos, Max grapples with the emotions tied to the museum's fate and his complex relationship with its guardian. A reminder of his childhood innocence surfaces when he interacts with his mother, who reassures him amidst the turmoil. The chapter highlights themes of loyalty, responsibility, and the weight of one's choices against the backdrop of an impending threat."

The dialogue begins with one character expressing disbelief about an insane mage wearing a mask. Another mentions a new skill, Anemione's Eye, which has a surveillance feature. Some uncertainty arises about sharing this with a friend named Knoung.There’s tension over ownership of the Rupture Museum, with one character asserting their rights while another pleads their case about shared responsibilities and fame. They flirt with the idea of starting a broadcasting station in the medieval-like setting of Lindel, aiming to introduce modern technologies and potentially monopolize the media industry. This entrepreneurial spirit evokes excitement, but a third-party character, Lee Kiyoung, questions the intentions behind this plan, hinting at possible manipulation.Throughout, there are humorous moments about their relationships, with some characters teasingly acknowledging their soulmate connection and playful threats. Amidst ambitions and schemes, one character expresses the need for rest but is encouraged to unwind at a hot spring, lightening the atmosphere after the busy expedition and responsibilities ahead.The chapter captures a blend of humor, ambition, and camaraderie among the characters as they navigate their personal and professional aspirations."

A character reflects on the emperor's declining health, pondering the importance of securing the princess and the emperor’s support for their own comfort. The beauty is so radiant, they compliment, trying to ingratiate themselves with the surrounding noble class. However, there's a sharp awareness of the underlying motivations, with dialogue suggesting that their flattery is seen as mere ass-kissing.The chapter highlights a gathering at the imperial palace where the new appointments to the Eight Seats of the Empire are introduced. The timing is very sudden, one character notes, hinting at possible ulterior motives behind this announcement. There's a sense of urgency as they contemplate the emperor's intentions and a pledge that seems to loom on the horizon. The interactions are charged, and it's evident that not all attendees are on friendly terms, as indicated by multiple characters’ open disdain for each other.Throughout the banquet, misunderstandings and sharp exchanges occur, with characters sarcastically mocking the emperor’s role as a puppet marionette. Among the chaos, the importance of maintaining alliances and appearances is clear, and the once-seemingly corrupt imperial family is unexpectedly viewed with a glimmer of hope by the common people.As the chapter concludes with a mix of uncertainty and determination, the characters brace themselves for the challenges ahead, preparing for the political games that are bound to ensue. I was blinded by His Majesty’s dignified presence, one admits, epitomizing the blend of reverence and skepticism that marks the era they inhabit."

I can’t just ignore her! Everyone’s watching!As tensions rise, the other nobles express their doubt about Charlia’s fitness to be empress, viewing her behavior as reckless. **Noble:** She really is unfit to become an empress.Simultaneously, there’s a scheme brewing among those who see the opportunity to gain favor by aligning with the more favorable second princess, who despite being born of a mistress, receives the emperor's affection.**Kiyoung:** If I succeed in winning her trust, my safety and survival in this empire are guaranteed.Their motives intertwine as the royal family grapples with the growing discord and the threat of war. The underlying enmity among Princess Charlia, who is shown to make poor decisions, and her half-sister only intensifies the stakes.**Maids:** If Charlia became empress, the empire would probably fall.As the chapter closes, the scene sets for a brewing conflict amid royal antics, and the characters ponder the dark future ahead if the wrong leader ascends to power.**Maid:** The future of the empire is dark…The chapter encapsulates a blend of political intrigue, character interactions, and foreshadowing of conflict, establishing a chaotic but engaging narrative in the palace backdrop."

Go ahead and rest, showcasing the underlying connections and tensions among them.Someone acknowledges a shift in alliances, noting, I KNEW YOU WOULD SWITCH OVER TO CHARLIE OR CHARLIA, while another insists their change was for personal reasons tied to Hyunsung. They express relief at adjusting strategies, revealing they’ve been collaborating on a mana hologram project and brainstorming names like Goddess’ Mirror, highlighting a blend of tech advancement and royal ambition.As discussions progress, concerns arise regarding a potential counter-move from Charlotte. WHAT IS SHE GONNA DO? one character muses, reinforcing the looming threat of exposure and competitive tactics. The idea of using the hologram to expose her secret to the world sets the stage for a power play.Tensions peak with a personal conflict, as one character grapples with their emotions, stating, I CAN'T CROSS THE LINE HERE. This internal struggle heightens the narrative, as they acknowledge the manipulative dynamic at play, reflecting on how the situation allows them to gain leverage.Another character confronts their adversary directly, calling them absolute garbage, and voicing their struggle for recognition and agency. The deeper resentments surface regarding family ties, as one laments, THE REASON I AM IN THIS SITUATION IS BECAUSE OF THAT DAMNED BITCH CHARLOTTE, solidifying Charlotte as a formidable rival.Ultimately, this chapter culminates in a pact forged in ambition and resentment, with a vow to defeat her and claim a throne that represents their deep-seated rivalries and aspirations. It sets up an engaging conflict as both characters reveal their insecurities and plans to outmaneuver one another in the high-stakes game for power and acceptance."

Charlotte expresses disbelief at Charlia's rise, Oh my, you're like a completely different person now! and demands clarity, DUCHESS, WHAT'S GOING ON?Amidst the chaos, another character confesses their inability to support Princess Charlia, saying, “I will keep quiet about what happened considering all that you’ve done for us, so please leave.” Meanwhile, whispers circulate in the capital: Did you hear the news? Charlia did it again! That's why Princess Charlotte should take the throne.Honorary Bishop Lee Kiyoung is caught in the middle, murmuring, “I didn't do it on purpose...” while recognizing the dangerous potential of Princess Charlotte, contemplating the outcome if she were to become an insane dictator.The dialogue highlights the strategic thinking of the characters: “CHARLIA MAY BE STUPID, BUT SHE AT LEAST LIKES ME,” indicating a desire for control over chaotic circumstances.As tensions rise, there's a foreshadowing of conflict, with one character noting, “I knew that Charlotte wouldn’t just sit still; it makes sense why you were recommended...” leading to speculations of a war instigated by Charlotte.The chapter concludes with preparations for an important event, as they plan for the “Noble Teatime” gathering, a significant social affair. A character reassures another, She’s done well until now... so it’ll be fine!” revealing the mix of anxiety and hope as alliances form and tensions simmer in anticipation of the coming challenges."

Jibs reassures the Vice Guild Master, who worries that Hyunsung's priorities may not align with the looming dangers they face. Despite the urgency, Hyunsung simply asks the Vice Guild Master to hang in there and wait. Frustrated, she reflects on the gravity of her situation—she's being forced to marry the psychopath princess and fears for her own safety.As tensions rise, another character pushes for the Vice Guild Master to get a wedding dress commissioned, but the Vice Guild Master protests. A subplot unfolds with the Emperor’s suggestion that a character named Charlia be appointed as the successor, though the Vice Guild Master expresses disbelief and frustration at the Emperor’s intentions.Amidst this chaos, another character concocts a plan to prevent Charlotte from becoming the Empress, eventually leading to a dark contemplation about eliminating her altogether. Despite the ludicrous situation and multiple attempts to mitigate the dangers around them, there’s an underlying current of loyalty and the need to protect each other within this complicated political landscape. The Vice Guild Master resolves to strategize further with Hyunsung, indicating that their journey is far from over."

SELLING ']]","In this chapter, the characters grapple with the turmoil caused by Lee Kiyoung's radical views against monarchy, as he expresses a strong desire to create a world free from royal control. Kiyoung's frustrations spill over into a book he authored, critiquing the incompetent princesses and declaring his refusal to be manipulated by them. As the dialogue unfolds, a sense of urgency builds, with a character remarking, “I’ll have to buy him a gift...something expensive?” highlighting the tension surrounding Kiyoung’s discontent. The narrative deepens as the protagonist reflects on their past discrimination and dreams of equality, hinting at a slowly emerging plan for change. “The democracy that he’s fighting for is what I wished since I’ve been discriminated against all my life,” emphasizes a desire for revolution, albeit “carried out harmlessly.” Eventually, threads of the past emerge, with characters reminiscing about their lives, dreams, and regrets. The protagonist longs for simpler times, stating wistfully, “I just want to return to the Charlotte I used to be...an ordinary peasant.” However, the weight of their actions weighs heavily on them, as they confront their guilt over past decisions.The chapter crescendos with a sense of foreboding concerning the masked figures who could potentially derail their aspirations for peace and democracy. The protagonist, seeking to untangle the web of betrayal, must act swiftly to prevent history from repeating itself.Amidst a backdrop of chaos, “the empire does not belong to the royals but to the people,” reaffirms the chapter’s central theme of striving for a just society as characters prepare for a revolution in a world on the brink of change."

The Emperor dug his own grave! someone exclaims, highlighting the risk of appointing Princess Charlotte—an ally—to suppress the uprising. One character points out, What we need to worry about right now isn't the palace, but the neighboring nations, revealing concerns over external threats.Kiyoung expresses regret, admitting, I'm sorry for everything, while demonstrating commitment to protect his allies. Amidst these troubles, characters find solace in their dependable alliances; I believe in you, Alice... shows the confidence they have in each other.A letter reveals Alice’s changing life, where she reflects on her new role and aspirations for a democratic future, stating, I will establish a new nation with Kiyoung...so that you and my younger siblings no longer have to deal with discrimination. She struggles with fears but is determined, recognizing a shift within herself: It feels like something is burning within me when I see those eyes...there is no lower class in life. We are all equal.However, the stakes are raised as Alice becomes wary: Please burn all the letters that I've sent until now. The reality of hiding her identity intensifies, and she contemplates her role as Oscar, the revolutionary leader. If we fail, it'll be treason. If we succeed, it'll be a revolution.The chapter concludes with Alice aware of the palace's mobilization, realizing that the person that’s in charge of shutting us down is Charlotte, setting the stage for an impending showdown between her ideals and the oppressive forces within the monarchy."

Paul exclaims about how chaotic Princess Charlotte has become, revealing she was the one supporting the revolution while attempting to maintain the dignity of the nobles. Reflecting on her failure, he jokingly remarks, “That face! She’s mad!” as they ponder how she believed this revolution would be harmless but ended up being betrayed.The conversation shifts to the resolution of the revolution, noting how the class system was abolished and the royals, associated with Lee Kiyoung, faced ruin. One character highlights, “The situation was resolved fairly quickly,” indicating the efficiency of their actions. Later, they discuss establishing a temporary government since immediate appointments would be too obvious post-revolution.Oscar and another character consider bringing in reliable individuals for governance. Amidst this, someone expresses concern about Charlotte's agreement with Lee Kiyoung and her possible manipulation, leading to a dramatic outburst of frustration about the situation.As they plot the future, someone declares a desire for a holy democracy to replace the royal family, stressing the need for faith towards their goddess, Benigor. The clash between maintaining secular power and religious influence is evident as plans for a theocracy emerge.The chapter closes with a twist: a character with a crown raises questions about the newfound power dynamics as they witness the royals fleeing, indicating a swift shift in allegiances as soldiers join their cause. The overarching theme here is betrayal, power struggles, and the movement towards a new governance system, leaving readers eager to see how these tensions will unfold."
